# Main.py Fixes Applied - October 27, 2025

## ✅ ISSUES FIXED

### 1. Journey Steps Navigation (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Journey steps 1→2→3→4 were not clickable. Buttons only appeared conditionally.

**Solution Applied:**
- **Step 1 (Welcome)**: Button always visible - "🚀 Go to Welcome" → `main.py`
- **Step 2 (Join FREE)**: Button always visible:
  - If authenticated: "✅ View Dashboard" → `pages/04_Dashboard.py`
  - If not: "✍️ Register Now" → `pages/03_Registration.py`
- **Step 3 (FREE Tier)**: Button always visible:
  - If resume built: "✅ View Resume" → `pages/05_Resume_Upload.py`
  - If not: "📝 Build Resume" → `pages/10_Your_Current_Resume.py`
- **Step 4 (Upgrade)**: Button always visible - "💎 View Pricing" → `pages/06_Pricing.py`

**Key Change:** Removed conditional rendering (`if not authenticated`, `if not resume_built`). 
All buttons now ALWAYS display, but labels change based on user state.

---

### 2. Pricing Section Rendering (CRITICAL FIX)
**Problem:** Large HTML block (120+ lines) not rendering properly - showed blank or "loading".

**Solution Applied:**
- Removed monolithic HTML `<div>` with nested grid layout
- Replaced with **Streamlit native `st.columns(4)`** approach
- Each pricing card is now:
  - Small HTML header (gradient background + price)
  - Native Streamlit markdown for features list
- Broke one giant HTML block into 4 separate mini-blocks

**Pricing Structure (FINAL):**
```
┌─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┬─────────────────┐
│ 🆓 Free Starter │ ⭐ Monthly Pro  │ 🏆 Annual Pro   │ 👑 Enterprise   │
│      $0         │    $15.99       │   $149.99/year  │   $299.99       │
│  10 tokens/mo   │  100 tokens/mo  │  250 tokens/mo  │  1000 tokens/mo │
│                 │                 │  ⚡ BEST VALUE   │                 │
└─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┴─────────────────┘
```

### 3. Dual-Career Feature Added to Annual Pro

- Sets expectation for partner data upload capability
- Points to future 25_Relocation_Calculator.py implementation

---

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES STILL REQUIRING ATTENTION

### Issue #1: Dual-Career Feature NOT Implemented
**Status:** ❌ **MISSING**

**What Exists:**
- Backend function: `get_dual_career_feasibility(user1_id, user2_id, location)` in `intellicv_pro/core/gpt5_orchestrator.py`
- Documentation references to 25_Relocation_Calculator.py

**What's Missing:**
- `pages/25_Relocation_Calculator.py` page (NOT in current pages directory)
- Partner data upload form
- Joint job search interface
- Geographic optimization for couples
- Coordinated marketing system

**User Expectation:**
> "upload their partner data and optimise the best search for roles with both their aspirations... do the marketing for them and their partner at the same time"

**Next Steps:**
1. Create `pages/25_Relocation_Calculator.py`
2. Build partner profile upload form
3. Connect to backend `get_dual_career_feasibility()` function
4. Implement dual-optimization UI
5. Add to Career Intelligence Suite description
6. Create navigation link from main dashboard

---

### Issue #2: feature_gating.py Price Discrepancy
**Status:** ⚠️ **INCONSISTENT**

**Problem:** 
- `utils/feature_gating.py` line 42-50: Monthly Pro price = `$9.99`
- `TOKEN_BASED_PRICING_SYSTEM.md`: Monthly Pro price = `$15.99`
- Main.py now shows: `$15.99` ✓

**Requires:**
Update `feature_gating.py` SUBSCRIPTION_FEATURES dict:
```python
'monthly': {
    'name': 'Monthly Pro',
    'price': 15.99,  # Change from 9.99 to 15.99
    'tokens': 100,
    # ... rest of config
}
```

**Impact:** Billing logic may use wrong price if not corrected.
