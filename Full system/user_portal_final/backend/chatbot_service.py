   - Prepare system design examples

**3. Behavioral Prep** (3-4 days before):
   - Use STAR method for 8-10 stories
   - Practice out loud (record yourself!)
   - Prepare questions to ask them

**4. Day-of Checklist**:
   - T-24h: Review notes, light practice

   - **Low Impact**: Delegate or skip

**2. Learning Approaches:**
   - **Projects** (70%): Learn by doing real work
   - **Mentorship** (20%): Learn from others
   - **Courses** (10%): Structured learning

**3. Validation:**
   - Build something real (portfolio project)
   - Get certified (if relevant to your field)
   - Teach others (best way to solidify)

**4. Time Investment:**
   - Dedicate 5-10 hours/week
   - Track progress weekly
   - Review quarterly

For your current career stage, I recommend focusing on:
1. **Technical depth** in your core domain (become the go-to expert)
