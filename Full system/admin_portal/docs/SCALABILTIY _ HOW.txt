SCALABILTIY _ HOW? 

Scalability Review
Current Limitations
•	In-memory, hardcoded data: All user, role, log, and session data are static and lost on restart. This is not scalable or persistent.
•	No database integration: Cannot handle thousands of users, concurrent edits, or real-time updates.
•	No pagination or lazy loading: All users are loaded at once, which will be slow with large datasets.
•	No real add/edit/deactivate logic: Actions are simulated, not persisted.
•	No authentication/authorization: Anyone can access and perform actions.
•	No audit trail or logging for actions.

What to Add for Scalability
1. Database Integration
•	Use a database (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite, or cloud DB) for users, roles, logs, and sessions.
•	Use an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy) or direct queries for CRUD operations.
2. Pagination & Search
•	Implement pagination for user lists and logs.
•	Use efficient search/filtering (SQL LIKE, full-text search, or indexed queries).
3. Real Add/Edit/Deactivate
•	Replace simulated actions with real forms and database updates.
•	Use modal dialogs or dedicated pages for user CRUD.
4. Authentication & Authorization
•	Integrate authentication (e.g., Streamlit Authenticator, OAuth, or custom).
•	Restrict actions based on user roles.
5. Audit Logging
•	Log all admin/user actions to the audit log table.
6. Session Management
•	Track sessions in the database, not in-memory.
7. Error Handling & Validation
•	Add robust error handling and input validation for all forms.
8. API Layer (Optional)
•	For larger systems, consider a REST API backend for user management, with Streamlit as the frontend.
