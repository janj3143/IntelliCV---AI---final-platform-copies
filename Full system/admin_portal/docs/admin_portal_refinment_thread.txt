Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan to address your request:

1. Re-run Page and Content Review (including career_intelligence_platform)
Additional Elements from career_intelligence_platform:

01_About.md
02_Features_Overview.md
03_System_Architecture.md
04_Semantic_NLP_Engine.md
05_Admin_Backoffice.md
06_Visualization_Analytics.md
07_Resume_Booklet_Export.md
08_Career_Scraper.md
09_Semantic_Graphs.md
10_Acronym_Thesaurus_Management.md
11_User_Workflows.md
12_Admin_Workflows.md
13_Technical_Stack.md
14_Implementation_Roadmap.md
README.md
2. Add to Review and Assess Value
Documentation: These markdown files provide valuable documentation, workflow, and architecture details.
Feature Mapping: Some files (e.g., 03_System_Architecture.md, 05_Admin_Backoffice.md, 06_Visualization_Analytics.md) map directly to existing or planned admin portal features.
Workflow & Roadmap: 11_User_Workflows.md, 12_Admin_Workflows.md, 14_Implementation_Roadmap.md can inform admin portal workflow pages or onboarding guides.
3. Create Additional Pages if Needed
If any features or documentation from career_intelligence_platform are not represented in the current pages list, create new pages in admin_portal_final:

Example: If there is no system_architecture.py, create one based on 03_System_Architecture.md.
For workflows, create user_workflows.py and admin_workflows.py as needed.
4. Move Latest Files to admin_portal_final
Move all consolidated, newly created, or updated files (pages, documentation, scripts) to admin_portal_final.
Do not leave any new or final files in admin_portal to avoid confusion.
Consolidation Suggestions
Documentation:

Move all markdown files from career_intelligence_platform to a docs folder in admin_portal_final.
Feature Pages:

For each major feature described in the markdowns, ensure there is a corresponding .py page in admin_portal_final.
If missing, create a new page (e.g., visualization_analytics.py, semantic_graphs.py, resume_booklet_export.py).
Workflow Pages:

Create user_workflows.py and admin_workflows.py in admin_portal_final if not present.
Technical/Architecture:

Use 03_System_Architecture.md and 13_Technical_Stack.md to inform or update the system_architecture.py page.
Next Steps
Move all relevant markdowns to admin_portal_final/docs/.
Create new .py pages in admin_portal_final for any missing features/workflows.
Update the dashboard and navigation to include these new pages.
Remove or archive outdated/legacy files from admin_portal.
