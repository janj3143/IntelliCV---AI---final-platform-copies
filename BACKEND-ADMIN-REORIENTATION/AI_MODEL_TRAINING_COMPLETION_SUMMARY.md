## 🎯 WHAT WAS BUILT

### Section 1: Model Training System ✅
**File:** `backend/ai_services/model_trainer.py` (570 lines)

**Purpose:** Train AI models on real IntelliCV data with admin oversight

**Key Features:**
- Trains on existing CV data from `IntelliCV-data/` directory
- Supports multiple training scenarios (5 default scenarios included)
- Admin review queue for flagged predictions
- Error deviation detection (confidence drops, outliers, consistency issues)
- Correction feedback loop - admin fixes automatically improve training
- Model versioning with A/B testing capability
- Performance metrics tracking (accuracy, precision, recall, F1)

**5 Default Training Scenarios:**
1. **job_title_classifier** - Neural Network (0.75 confidence threshold)
2. **skills_extractor** - Hybrid AI (0.70 confidence threshold)
3. **company_classifier** - Neural Network (0.65 confidence threshold)
4. **industry_classifier** - Bayesian (0.80 confidence threshold)
5. **experience_analyzer** - Neural Network (0.70 confidence threshold)

**Integration:** Works with Neural Network Engine, provides training data management

- Continuous learning from user feedback
- Auto-retraining when feedback buffer reaches 500 items
- Embeddings cache for performance optimization
- Comprehensive logging and performance tracking

**Confidence Levels:**
- **High:** ≥ 0.85 (very confident)
- **Medium:** 0.65 - 0.85 (moderately confident)
- **Low:** 0.45 - 0.65 (uncertain)
- **Very Low:** < 0.45 (should be reviewed)

**Integration:** Feeds predictions to Model Trainer and Feedback Loop Engine

---

### Section 3: Expert System Engine ✅
**File:** `backend/ai_services/expert_system_engine.py` (780 lines)

**Purpose:** Rule-based validation and explainable AI

**Key Features:**
- 10 default business rules across 5 categories
- Admin-editable rules (add/update/delete/enable/disable)
- Priority-based rule evaluation (1-10 scale, higher = more important)
- Explainable AI - generates human-readable explanations
- Safe rule evaluation using sandboxed Python expressions
- Rule performance tracking (trigger counts, validation history)
- Auto-save rules to JSON for persistence
- Rule categories: job_title, skills, company, industry, experience

**10 Default Business Rules:**

**Job Title Rules:**
1. **JT001** (Priority 8): Senior titles require 5+ years experience
2. **JT002** (Priority 9): C-level positions require leadership skills
3. **JT003** (Priority 10): Cannot be both junior AND senior

**Skills Rules:**
4. **SK001** (Priority 8): Developer roles must have programming languages
5. **SK002** (Priority 5): Flag duplicate skills

**Company Rules:**
6. **CO001** (Priority 4): Company name formatting validation
7. **CO002** (Priority 7): Cannot have company AND be freelance

**Industry Rules:**
8. **IN001** (Priority 6): Skills should align with industry

**Experience Rules:**
9. **EX001** (Priority 10): Experience years must be 0-50 (reject if invalid)
10. **EX002** (Priority 8): Experience must match career timeline

**Integration:** Validates predictions from Neural Network and other AI engines

### Section 4: Feedback Loop Engine ✅
**File:** `backend/ai_services/feedback_loop_engine.py` (850 lines)

**Purpose:** Orchestrate continuous learning across all AI engines

**Key Features:**
- Ensemble prediction system - all engines vote, best result wins
- 3 ensemble voting methods (configurable)
- Automatic feedback distribution to all engines
- Cross-engine learning (NN learns from Bayesian, ES learns from NLP, etc.)
- Performance tracking per engine (accuracy, confidence calibration)
- Auto-weight adjustment - better engines get higher voting weights
- Retraining triggers - auto-retrain after 100 feedback items
- Persistence - saves feedback queue and performance to disk

**3 Ensemble Voting Methods:**

1. **Weighted Vote (Default):**
   - Score = engine_weight × prediction_confidence
   - Best engines have more influence
   - Automatically adjusts weights based on accuracy

2. **Highest Confidence:**
   - Trust the most confident engine
   - Simple and fast
   - Good when one engine is clearly expert

3. **Majority Vote:**
   - Democratic voting
   - Agreement ratio becomes confidence
   - Good for balanced decisions

**How It Works:**
```
User Request → Feedback Loop Engine
               ↓
   [Neural Network] votes → 0.87 confidence
   [Bayesian]       votes → 0.76 confidence
   [Expert System]  votes → 0.92 confidence
   [NLP]            votes → 0.81 confidence
   [LLM]            votes → 0.79 confidence
   [Fuzzy Logic]    votes → 0.73 confidence
               ↓
   Weighted Vote → Best Prediction (0.89 avg confidence)
               ↓
   User Provides Correction? 
               ↓
   YES → Distribute to ALL engines
               ↓
   Each engine learns from correction
               ↓
   After 100 corrections → Auto-retrain all engines
```

**Performance Tracking:**
- Total predictions per engine
- Correct predictions / total = accuracy
- Average confidence per engine
- Confidence calibration (how well confidence predicts accuracy)
- Auto-adjust weights: higher accuracy = higher voting weight

**Integration:** Connects all AI engines in continuous learning cycle

**Data Flow:**

1. **Training Phase:**
   - Admin creates scenario in UI → Model Trainer
   - Model Trainer loads CVs from IntelliCV-data/
   - Neural Network trains on data
   - Expert System validates predictions
   - Predictions saved to review queue if confidence low

2. **Prediction Phase:**
   - Request comes to Feedback Loop
   - Feedback Loop asks all engines to vote
   - Neural Network provides embedding-based prediction
   - Bayesian/NLP/LLM provide their predictions
   - Expert System validates against rules
   - Feedback Loop combines votes → final prediction

3. **Learning Phase:**
   - Admin reviews flagged predictions in UI
   - Admin provides corrections
   - Feedback Loop distributes corrections to ALL engines
   - Each engine learns from correction
   - After 100 corrections → auto-retrain
