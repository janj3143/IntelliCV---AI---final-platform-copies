## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Structure: enhanced_data
```python
{
    'skill_mapping': {
        'technical_skills': [...],
        'professional_skills': [...]
    },
    'career_suggestions': [...],
    'industry_match': [...],
    'market_intelligence': {...},
    'performance_metrics': {
        'confidence_score': 0.87,
        'experience_level': 'Mid-Level Professional'
    }
}
```

### Session State Variables
- `resume_data`: Main resume information
- `ai_summary_edits`: User's editable summary fields
- `ai_original_experience`: Original AI assessment (for validation)

### Validation Logic
```python
# Content expansion check
expansion_ratio = edited_length / original_length
if expansion_ratio > 1.5:
    block_save()

# Experience level check
level_jump = current_idx - original_idx
if level_jump > 1:
    block_save()
```

## Integration Points

### Admin Portal Integration
- `user_portal_admin_integration.py`: Connection to admin AI systems
- `process_resume_with_admin_ai()`: Resume parsing function
- Returns `enhanced_data` dict with all parsed information

### Feature Gating
- Resume upload respects subscription tiers
- Advanced AI features require paid plans
- Mock data bypasses restrictions for testing

## Known Issues & Warnings
1. Some AI data directories not found (expected in test mode)
2. Enhanced Job Title Engine partially available (non-blocking)
3. Real AI Data Connector loaded successfully (548 lines, 3,418+ JSON files)

## Next Steps for Production
1. Replace mock data with actual AI parsing
2. Connect to real Stripe payment gateway
3. Implement database persistence (currently session-only)
4. Add admin dashboard for flagged profiles
5. Upload actual Dean Cooper CV and test real parsing
6. Implement resume history tracking
7. Add export functionality for edited summaries
