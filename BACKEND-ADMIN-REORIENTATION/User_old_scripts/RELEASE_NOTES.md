   ```

2. **Create Enhanced Engine**
   ```python
   class Enhanced[Feature]Engine:
       def __init__(self, portal_bridge=None):
           self.portal_bridge = portal_bridge
           self.ai_active = portal_bridge is not None
   ```

3. **Add Visual Indicators**
   ```python
   if AI_MODE_ACTIVE:
       st.success("🟢 AI MODE ACTIVE")
   else:
       st.info("🟡 DEMO MODE ACTIVE")
   ```

See integrated pages for complete examples.
