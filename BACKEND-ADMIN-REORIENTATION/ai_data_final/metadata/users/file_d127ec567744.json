Additional CURRENT REQUIREMENTS\nThe current requirement:\nMarketing / Market Maker / Product & Strategic Marketing – Personal Care\nLocation UK/IT/DE/BNL\nThis role is part of the global push in growing the personal global group\nPersonal care is seen as a key pillar to the growth of the Sasol Chemicals Division\nThe organisation has relatively flat structure at the moment and is probably under resourced in EMEA and USA\nMarket Maker / Product Management – provides the link between the Formulations / Applications and the Key Account Managers / Business Development Manager via the Strategic Leadership\nKey areas of responsibility are VOCE – Voice of the Customer / Pricing and Product guidance to the various teams so that the right products are in the loop at the right time and for the right price. Additionally, there needs to be a liaison between the Manufacturing team to make sure they are on side when it comes to volumes and availability\nOur target focus will initially be candidates who fit this element of the recruitment brief – namely people who have the ideal skillset and soft skills. This means they will inevitably come from a competing organisation -\nAs per the BDM role Drive / Energy / Persistence and an entrepreneurial nature are too name a few – key factors in determining the right candidate\nMarketing is an area where it is critical to have the right soft skills on one hand you are dealing with applications people – typical scientists and on the other you are dealing internally with sales and most importantly externally with the clients.\nAn outgoing and confident attitude is one of the major factors in the selection process here.\nSalaries in the marketing sector vary significant and are typically biased towards age and experience – they can vary widely in larger organisations at the upper 85K end to mid sized organisations 50-80K.\nOne thing to consider is the capability of the candidate to have worked in an organisation which has an international reach and exposure to different countries in the wider Europe will have significant impact to the success of the individual. Nuance in countries and how the end products are position mean a lot – and getting this wrong from a ingredient / chemicals perspective is a significant risk. Regulatory knowledge would also be useful\nWe have structure our offer in a staggered 3 stage manner – this is set as such with the greater incentive focused on the final delivery element. It has been specifically designed this way as this will be the first Sasol project and have based it upon the mid point of the expected salary\nIt is our policy to stay clear of current JVCL clients such as BASF and as such we will search in these companies – this approach will be similarly respected in the future with Sasol\nFEE STRUCTURE\nOur typical fees for this search would be 25%, This enables to maintain our long-standing relationship and remain competitive.\nThe costs applicable are broken down into three stages, as follows:\nAll charges are subject to Value Added Tax at the current rate where applicable.\nExpenses\nThe costs applicable in respect of the Retainer are in relation to the Client’s initial instructions to and/or appointment of the Company and all preparatory work undertaken whether on after or before the signing of this agreement. As part of the assignment service we provide, all candidates put forward at shortlist stage will have been personally interviewed and vetted. The expense allocation for interviews, meetings, travel, sustenance, etc. is payable by the client on receipt of invoice, clearly Johnston Vere will endeavour to keep these costs to an absolute minimum.\nGUARANTEE\nIn the event of payment having been received in accordance with our payment terms, then in the event of a candidate leaving of their own volition, we operate a sliding scale refund system:\nIf the candidate leaves within 4 weeks, 75% of the final fee is refunded.\nIf the candidate leaves within 8 weeks, 50% of the final fee is refunded.\nIf the candidate leaves within 12 weeks, 25% of the final fee is refunded.\nA client can elect a replacement candidate in lieu of a refund.\nTHE RECRUITMENT PROCESS\nABOUT US\nJohnston Vere is a niche recruitme",
