PetroSIM was used as a simulation tool for \nthis feasibility study. He was an integral part of this transformation with estimated margin uplift \nof 20+ MM$/year.  \n• Developed effective fractionator tuning and product blending t echniques to improve the cetane \nnumber of hydrocracked diesel to improve sales volume of premium diesel by 50%.  \n• First Hydrocracker Engineer who implemented pilot plant test for hydrocracking catalyst \nselection with execution and interpretation methodolog y developed. hte GmbH was selected as \nan independent pilot plant testing company. This practice is now the new standard for modern \nhydrocracking catalyst selection in PTTGC.  \n• Modified hydrocracker fractionator so it can additionally recover 2% more heavy naphtha (if \nrequired).  \n• Leaded major projects, from basic to detailed design, such as:  \n1. Diesel rundown capacity debottleneck, 20% additional diesel draw  \n2. Hydrocracker feed preheating, 10 degC additional feed temperature  \n3. Wash water capacity debottle neck, 30% additional wash water to the problematic area  \n4. CDU overhead compression debottlenecking with estimated fuel saving by 2% at the \ncrude heater.  \n \nPower Plant and Utilities  \nKey achievements:  \n• Gas turbine downtime reduction by 50% by air filter upgr ading.  \n• Water transfer syste",
