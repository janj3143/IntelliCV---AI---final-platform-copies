I am interested in opportunities to join a well-established team or, forming of a new team for new markets. Ideally the B&P function will work closely with the directorship to ensure we deliver their vision, as well as to enable feedback in best positioning our business to win opportunities. I have started a family and as such am looking for a company to commit to long-term and earn a reputation within it for excellence through consistently delivering winning proposals.\nCompetency Summary\nPersonal Statement\nThe trajectory of my life was set when I was diagnosed with cancerous brain tumour at 13, which meant years of battling, uncertainty and frustrating disruption to my education. I would leave education aged 17 seeking results more in-line with my expectations, believing I would better develop within a professional environment. Starting in a junior office role, I spent the next decade developing my commercial acumen, underpinned by an intrinsic soft-skillset – attributes that I believe can emerge from challenging life experience . In 2013 I progressed to the position of B&P Manager and after 5 years in that role I was in a position to take up education again with an aim to complete a part of my life unresolved.\nIn 2018 I went about the work required to secure a university place, including completing my A-levels, applications & entry exams – in 2019 I secured a place at University College Cork studying Philosophy & Sociology. To support myself during studies, I became certified as a part-qualified electrician and consulted for a small commercial business. In a satisfying resolution to my past, in 2022 I attained a 1st and intended to continue onto a masters however, during my second year at UCC I met my partner who had two young children - priorities changed. Having completed my degree, I began the process of starting my new family, selling my property in Cork and moving back to London to begin again my career by the end of 2023.\nPrerequisites of Bid Management are strong commercial knowledge, excellent stakeholder management and project management within the strictest of tolerances - the following section will offer evidence supporting my claim to these. The purpose however of this personal statement, aims to demonstrate the attributes necessary for excellent bid Management; resilience, determination, adaptability, intelligence & integrity. I propose possession of every one of these attributes were necessary to negotiate the trajectory that was set for me. I return to B&P with new ideas, considered perspectives and a refined approach that will ensure our bids are always deliverable, leave no competitive edge underleveraged and a cut above the rest.\nProfessional Experience\nCommercial Development Manager; PFW Consultancy Ltd, 2018 – Present Day\nThis consultancy position within a family business consists of three primary workstreams; exploring commercial opportunities across Ireland and the U.K.; ad-hoc document reviews/edit; and property management. Workstreams included:\nPreparation of reports on research and analysis of tenders and commercial opportunities;\nUndertaking market research; and\nManaging the company’s property portfolio.\nWhile this position was adequate to support myself during studying, I must now secure a career opportunity to support my new family in the long-term.\nBids & Proposals Manager; Cubic Transportation Systems, 2013 – 2018\nI was hired to co-manage Cubic’s bid to retain the TfL ticketing & revenue protection contract worth in excess of £600 million. Following it’s submission, I joined the commercial department as a Bid Manager tasked with breaking into new markets; geographical, moving beyond the UK & US markets and; Innovation, leveraging our extensive experience gained through a solutions orientated approach to develop and propose products to private and state transportation authorities.
