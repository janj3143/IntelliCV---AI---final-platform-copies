After gaining useful experience in project engineering and draughting roles, I  opted \nto focus on the safety and reliability aspects of engineering.

In addition, I am actively \nworking towards achieving  Chartered Engineer (CEng) status with the Institution of Engineering and Technology \n(IET).  \nProfessional  Experience  \nSystem Safety Engineer at Expleo      January  2021 to Present  \nI provide  direct system safety engineering support to two of Expleo’s major engineering clients in the defence \nsector  (via s eparate contracts) . The  first contract  focussed on  the functional and physical safety aspects associated \nwith a ‘future submarine’ programme, which was in t he 'Manufacturing' phase of the CADMID cycle. I produced \nkey safety deliverables, such as hazard log updates and the generation of Design Safety Justification (DSJ) reports, \nwithin extremely tight timeframes . In addition,  I supplied weekly progress reports  to my client (Expleo), which \nthey utilised to inform their key stakeholders (within Expleo's client's organisation) during high -level meetings. I \nreceived outstandingly positive feedback from the key stakeholders with regards to my overall contribution to  the \nsystem safety aspects of the 'future submarine' programme.  \nThe second cont ract currently f ocusses on the non -functional (physical), functional, and operational safety aspects \nassociated with a  ‘mine countermeasures ’ system of systems , whic h is currently in the ‘Demonstration ’ and \n‘Manufacturing ’ phases of the CADMID cycle, depending on the specific sub -system in question. I manage the \noverarching hazard log for the e ntire programme. In addition, I chair hazard log review meetings and ensure that \nrelevant actions are follow -up in a timely manner. I also attend site meetings , on the request of Expleo ’s client, \nwhen requ ired and report my findings to the Programme Lead(s) . I supply weekly progress reports to my client \n(Expleo) , which contri butes to Expleo ’s progress reports to their client.  \nSafety Engineer at Babcock International Group    September  2019 to December 2020  \nI provided system safety engineering services as contingent resource to the Safety Services Group (SSG), who \nsupport Babcock’s Engineering Delivery Group (EDG) in delivering design changes to the MoD, with occasional \ntravel to MoD Abbey Wood to attend key safety -related meetings. Prior to scribing  and/or co-chairing these \nmeetings, I produced Hazard Identification and Assessment (HIA) briefing packs, w hich included  Environmental \nImpact Screening and Scoping (EISS), in preparation for stimulating relevant di scussions and recording the main \noutcomes. I also drafted the primary deliverable(s); the  subsequent Safety and Environmental Assessment Report \n(SEAR)  for the design change under assessment . \nOther activities I completed during this contract included (but w ere not limited to): Project management activities, \nincluding liaising with MoD/SSMG task owners to arrange meetings and ensuring that project deliverables are \nproduced to the correct specifications and in accordance with the project delivery schedule; Rev iew of safety \ndeliverables produced by Babcock Energy and Marine (E&M) and BMT; Updating Safety Summary Reports \n(SSRs); Using SSMG applications, including Soter, R -DAR and Design Change; and mentoring other team \nmembers, including new graduates (as part of  the Babcock Engineering Graduate Scheme), by assigning tasks, \nmonitoring progress, and providing useful feedback.  \nSafety Consultant at BMT       December 201 8 to July 2019  \nI was responsible for producing Safety and Environmental Case Reports (SECRs) for eq uipment used on surfaced \nmaritime platforms with a UK defence application.
