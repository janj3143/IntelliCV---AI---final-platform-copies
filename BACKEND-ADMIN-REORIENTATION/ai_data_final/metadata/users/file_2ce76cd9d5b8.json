I have read the job advert / description and feel my skills and experience lend well to the vacancy.\nI have a deep understanding of the autoimmunity market gained through commercial and practical experience.  As a HCPC registered Biomedical Scientist I have validated, used and maintained chemiluminescence methodology to investigate autoimmune, infectious, endocrine, anaemia and cardiac disease.  Whilst working in a medical laboratory I gained valuable experience necessary to deliver user focused strategy for product success in the commercial market.\nWhilst working for A.Menarini as Autoimmunity Product Manager I successfully managed IFA and chemiluminescence product life cycles, from concept through to successful implementation.  The autoimmunity market is complex and relatively niche.  I have well rounded knowledge of this market that facilitates market growth and improved customer satisfaction, as evidenced by my time at A.Menarini.  Through my previous Product Manager role I received technical sales training and achieved a high level of competence.  This training and experience, coupled with laboratory management experience results in comprehensive procurement knowledge to support sales activity.\nI enjoy delivering training material and education.  There has been a thread of responsibility for training throughout a varied career which includes guest lecturing and mentoring at undergraduate and postgraduate level.  As A.Menarini Product Manager I developed training material to meet ISO requirements for both internal and external users.\nIf given the opportunity I would be excited to work with IDS.  I feel the culture and vision outlined by the organisation matches my own.  I am passionate, enjoy challenge and innovation and maintain high professional standards for those and colleagues.\nPlease refer to my C.V. for more information.\nYours faithfully,\nJake Morrow BSc (Hons) MSc CSci MIBMS ",
