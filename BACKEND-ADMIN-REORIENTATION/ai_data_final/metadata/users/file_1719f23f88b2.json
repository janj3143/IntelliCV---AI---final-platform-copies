This incl udes reactor bed \nprofiles monitoring and coordinating with procurement team to review technical bids by \nVendors.  \n• Participated in new major refinery projects/expansions activities including FEED, EPC, MC \nWalkthroughs, PSSRs and commissioning ensuring the project execution was up to design \nstandards.  \n• Participated in many HAZOP, LOPA, MOC technical reviews and SIL reviews ensuring that all \nprocess designs, and modifications are safe during implementation.  \n• Coordinated catalyst bed replacement activities w ith licensor and contractor ensuring correct \nloading configuration was achieved for optimum operating conditions. This includes sock and \ndense loading.  \n • Ensured environmental regulations are met for refinery wastewater treatment plant by \nmaintaining healt h of bacteria in the system, dosing of chemicals and safe removal of produced \nsludge and waste material.  \n• Continuous monitoring, troubleshooting and optimization of sulphur recovery (Clause process), \nhydrogen manufacturing (SMR), amine regeneration, sour water treatment and spent caustic \ntreatment.  \n• Coordinated with integrity team and chemical vendors for maintaining and optimizing health of \nthe utility systems such as steam, steam condensate, boiler feed water, fresh cooling water and \ndesalinated water.  \n• Participated in plant Turnaround, working many hours overtime, to conduct vessel, tray and \nexchanger inspection, catalyst loading and ensuring all necessary modifications were \nimplemented on time.  \n \n \nCOMMENT  \n \nA Senior process engineer with 7+ years’ experience in one of the largest refineries in the world. I have \na background in Hydrogen manufacturing, Sulfur Recovery (Claus Process), Sour water, amine \ntreatment, utilities and wastewater treatment. He has  consistently monitored, troubleshooted and \noptimized systems to achieve the best results. In his career, he has  implemented a refinery information \nsystem, reduced operating costs, and worked on the FEED, EPC, and commissioning of 3 refinery \nexpansion projec ts. He is  very hard -working with recognised career -based achievements, and has \nstrong personal skills proving my ability to fulfil my teams and organizations objectives . \n \nKey achievements:  \n• System Development – Coordinated with Honeywell for the development of Refinery \nInformation System by providing full inputs of critical assets monitoring and mass/energy \nbalances for utility systems.  \n• Plant life extension – Closely monitoring and optimizing catalyst performance allowing for \nextension of catalyst life reducing cost of p rocuring new catalyst and production downtime.  \n• Optimized Performance – Hydrogen network optimization by studying economics of different \nhydrogen producers in the network and applying optimization tools for selecting the ideal load \nsharing configuration.  \n• Chemical Change – Reduced maintenance requirement for Sour wat",
