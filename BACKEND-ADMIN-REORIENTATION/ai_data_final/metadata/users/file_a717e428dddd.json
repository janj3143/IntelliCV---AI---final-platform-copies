This and the tenacity I have always exhibited have been the foundation to achieve significant sales success.   I have actively driven new business growth and exceeded sales targets. This is exemplified by my active selling of excess inventory inherited from my predecessor, which brought in over 100K after tough negotiations.  Another example was the EURO 2008 project, where I led the sales of merchandising items of circa 250K, directly benefitting in year financial performance. Due to dealer exclusive rights, we were unable to sell directly to the customer so I had to find an ingenious solution to realise the 250K turnover.  I am looking for an ambitious and modern employer, which is professionally organized and future-oriented, so that I can focus on my passion for acquisition and customer service.
