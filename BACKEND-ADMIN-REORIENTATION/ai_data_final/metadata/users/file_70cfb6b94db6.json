I am eager  for a  new opportunity to utilise my skills and \nknowledge where I can make a meaningful contribution towards  driving sustainability solutions to help \nsolve both business and climate change challenges.  \n \nEducation             \n2013–2017  The University of Sheffield  \nMEng (Hons) Che mical Engineering              Obtained Result: 1st \nResearch Project:  \n• Developing low cost and renewable heterogeneous cata lysts for biodiesel production . \n• Synthesised  and optimised  various catalysts and developed  and trialled  a scale up procedure . \nDesign Project:  \n• Designed a bioethanol fermentation and separation plant in a team of engineers, incorporating \nnovel microbubble distillation and condensation  technology . Independently produced detailed \ndesign of the fermentation unit and plant layout.  \n2006–2013  Macclesfield High School/ College  \n  A Level s – Mathematics (B), Chemistry (B), Biology (B)  \n  AS Level s – Product Design (B)  \n  GCSE s – 14 (2A*, 6A, 6B) including Maths and English  \nRelevant  Experience            \nAug 2019  – Present   Process  Engineer – Wood PLC  \nDeveloped my core process engineering competencies on two world scale FEED project s; designing \na Natural Gas Fractionation facility to be built in the Middle East  and a separate PMC role on a project  \nto design a n olefin complex in Belgium.   Currently d eveloping a company -wide framework for \nembedding sustainability and reliability within i nfrastructure projects.  \n• Actively engage d with a range of stakeholders of varying seniority within the business to gain \n‘buy-in’ and manage strong working relationships to progress a Framework I am developing to \nembed Sustainability and Reliability into inf rastructure projects.  Developing materials to \ndemonstrate current inhouse capabilities and experience to clients.  \n• Responsible for performing adequacy studies on existing NGL fractionation facilities processing a \nchange in mixed feed composition. Developed a Hysys simulation to benchmark existing \nperformance and reviewed as -built equipment design documentation to ident ify bottlenecks and \nidentify potential mitigat ion options for the client to pursue.  \n• Performed study assessments to determine optimum configuration of a compressed air system \nconsidering, CAPEX, OPEX, plot space and safety considerations.  \n• Performed variou s technology and licensor evaluations considering technical feasibility and \neconomic assessments to enable clients to confidently make informed decisions.  Examples \ninclude spent caustic treatment technologies  and licensed sulfur removal units.  \n• Developed  and reviewed key engineering deliverables , such as; Basis of Design (BOD) , Process \nDrawings and Equipment Datasheets . \n• Won first place  in the Associate of Project Management Challenge 2020 , initiating and \ndeveloping a project to deliver grow kits, an  info pack  and lesson to educate children on \nsustainable growing.  As the commercial  lead, I ensured delivery of the project on time and within \nbudget.  \n \nSept 2017 – Aug 2019  Graduate Engineer – Affinity Water  \nGained valuable experience u ndertaking a range of  roles / projects on a two year  graduate schem e. \nProcess Optimisation P roject  \n• Lead a process optimisation project assessing  the performance of  a potable  water treatment site \nin terms of operating costs, process and product quality.  Established a methodology that has \nbeen adopted as the standard company approach  taken  by other  optimisation engineers . \n• Identified a series of solutions to mitigate inefficienc ies, reducing power  consumption , increasing \nwater  quality and re",
