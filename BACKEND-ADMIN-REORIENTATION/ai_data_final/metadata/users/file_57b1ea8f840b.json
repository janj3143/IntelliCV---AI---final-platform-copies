I would describe her as a “rainmaker” who by nature has seller-doer mentality but truly consultative in her approach. She is passionate about creating bespoke solutions for each customer that will offer long-term value for that organisation and enjoys working in a creative and innovative environment. She collaborates closely with other consulting teams in the business to ensure that she can offer the best possible solution for the customer.\nHer current role is Master Consultant for JMJ in London. This was a newly created role for her which she started in 2020 and it has responsibility for designing and delivery bespoke solutions to key clients’ needs. Prior to this she was a Senior Consultant with a ‘cradle to grave’ approach – she works with key customers up to C-suite level and promoting best practice and continuous improvement across JMJ, especially with mentoring and coaching of more junior staff.\nShe has strong relationships with multinational corporate customers in various sectors, some of which include BHP Billiton, Shell, BP, Maersk Oil, Qatar Petroleum, Centrica, Novo Nordisk etc. and proven experience in the international environment – Europe, Asia Pacific, Africa, North America.\nAs discussed recently, Gill is not actively looking but she is intrigued by what DEKRA are trying to achieve. She has heard mixed messages about the company’s past reputation but change management is something she loves and she likes the idea of playing an influential role in instigating a step change in an organisation and helping to develop the long-term roadmap for DEKRA Organisational & Process Safety.\nIf she were to make a move, she would need to be convinced that the company has the right strategic vision when it comes to sustainability, transformation initiatives (such as digital innovations), agile working etc. and would need to feel comfortable that Senior Management would support change management practices.\nWith this in mind, she is open to having an introductory call with you to discuss DEKRA and the O&PS business in more depth, after which she should hopefully have more assurance on whether it’s the right company for her or not.\nCurrent Package:\nDo not have exact breakdown but base salary in the £110/115k mark plus bonus and benefits.\nCandidate Name:\tGill Kernick\nPERSONAL DETAILS\nLocation: \t\tLondon, UK\nQUALIFICATIONS\nBachelor of Business Administration (Honours) Cum Laude – University of Natal, Durban (1993)\nSubjects included Training and Development, Corporate Strategy & Human Resource Management.\nBachelor of Commerce, Upper Second equivalent – University of Witwatersrand, Johannesburg (1992)\nProfessional:\nAcademy of Executive Coaching, Systemic Team Coaching (2017)\nCertified practitioner in Operating States (methodology to bring projects sustainably into existence) (2015)\nSchool of Coaching, Public Coaching Programme, Senior Practitioner (2013)\nMember of EMCC (2013)\nCAREER SUMMARY\n2011 to date JMJ Associates, London\n2020 to date\nPosition: Master Consultant – Sustainability, Safety & Operational Excellence\nBringing innovative approaches to designing and delivering bespoke solutions to client’s needs.
