This can also involve fitting and fixing tables, replacing advertising posters, seat bases, working on toilet systems, Water heaters, replacement or repairs of steam ovens on catering units, setting up of cctv cameras in saloons of the trains. I do setting up of internal and external door measurements, carrying out new modifications  and many more. My job involves me working to ( VMI ) vehicle maintenance instructions to all work carried out on trains.\nI have been passed out on under frame inspection of boogie units on the train.\nI was involved with interior vehicle rebuild too, this involved the entire removal of interior to two saloons of a 9car train. We had to then complete a modification of a partition wall and then re build the saloons again to the VMI ( vehicle maintenance instruction ) this involved electrical work too.\nI have also been trained and passed out on automatic interior door systems. I am currently working on 2 modifications, this is a GU modification to stop intercoolers over heating and to stop the inter-cooler drawing in any outside dirt to the GU. I am also working on a Reactor modification which involves fitting of mechanical and electrical reactor boxes to the underframe which gives off a magnetic force field to stop the GWR trains from interfering with track side signals in the Leeds area.\nAnother modification I’ve been involved with recently is auto coupler actuators. Stripping and replacing old actuators with new.\nThere are many more modifications and work that I’ve been involved with at GWR but I am willing  to discuss them verbally.\nI am also safety critical trained.\nMy job did involve inspection of brand new train units, this is to make sure that the train units are in 100% condition when they come to Hitachi depot and then subsequently sold on to GWR. All trains were sold in summer of 2019.\nPrevious​ ​Employment\nNov​ ​2010​ ​–​ ​July 2018 ​-​ ​Transport​ ​For​ ​London​   ​(Formerly​ ​Tubelines​ ​Ltd​  ​&​ ​Alstom​ ​Ltd)\nPosition​ ​Held​ ​-​ ​TM60​ ​(Maintenance​ ​Technician)\nMy​ ​role​ ​at​ ​TFL ​is​ ​to​ ​work​ ​within​ ​a​ ​team​ ​maintaining​ ​the​ ​trains​ ​for​ ​the​ ​jubilee​ ​line. ​ ​The​ ​main​ ​part​ ​of this​ ​maintenance​ ​is​ ​to​ ​perform​ ​the​ ​overhaul​ ​B​ ​and​ ​C​ ​examinations​ ​on​ ​the​ ​trains, ​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​this​ ​I would​ ​need​ ​to​ ​perform​ ​any​ ​other​ ​maintenance​ ​work​ ​that​ ​is​ ​required. ​ ​I​ ​have​ ​had​ ​extensive training to​ ​enable​ ​me​ ​to​ ​examine​ ​the​ ​trains, ​ ​this​ ​will​ ​consist​ ​of​ ​performing​ ​the​ ​B​ ​and​ ​C​ ​exams​ ​and prepping​ ​the​ ​trains​ ​(preparation​ ​of​ ​trains​ ​after​ ​any​ ​work​ ​has​ ​been​ ​done​ ​and​ ​the​ ​B​ ​and​ ​C​ ​exams have​ ​taken​ ​place​ ​on​ ​the​ ​trains​ ​every​ ​24​ ​hrs).\nAs​ ​well​ ​as​ ​the​ ​above​ ​I​ ​have​ ​been​ ​fully​ ​trained​ ​and​ ​passed​ ​off​ ​on​ ​the​ ​following​ ​Requirements:\nI​ ​have​ ​been​ ​trained​ ​in​ ​various​ ​Sopps​ ​which​ ​includes​ ​me​ ​to​ ​power​ ​up​ ​and​ ​down​ ​the trains.\nI​ ​have​ ​been​ ​passed​ ​off​ ​in​ ​my​ ​Connect​ ​Radio​ ​which​ ​means​ ​I​ ​can​ ​rail​ ​drivers​ ​out​ ​of​ ​the depot​ ​into​ ​service.\nI​ ​have​ ​been​ ​passed​ ​off​ and​ ​fully​ ​trained​ ​as​ ​a​ ​SST​  ​(Service​ ​Support​ ​Technician)",
