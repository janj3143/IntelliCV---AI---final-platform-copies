I am required to be up to date with all projects the company completed to appropriately advise contract managers and design engineers. During my time at AiPS, revenue more than tripled as the scale and complexity of projects significantly increased. As a result, my skills to handle multiple projects simultaneously grew exponentially. Main responsibilities include:\nDevelopment of PIDs and associated documentation, including detailed specifications, equipment schedules and process description documentation\nHAZOP and LOPA assessment participation as lead AiPS engineer.\nManaging design change requests from both internal and external sources including client and suppliers.\nAdvise and direct junior process engineers and design engineers on good engineering practices and relevant standards.\nDesign review and approval of PID, detailed design drawings, 3D models.\nTechnical support during construction and commissioning phase of large-scale projects.\nEnsure that work was completed to appropriate engineering standards, such as BS 60079 for ATEX installations\nMusk Process Services\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\tSeptember 2018–July 2020\nJunior Process Engineer/Process Engineer\nI was responsible for complete process design from initial concept and quote with client through to detailed design and eventual commissioning upon project conclusion. Each project was based on a process improvement requirement from a client.\nDeveloped detailed P&IDs to suit client needs and requirements.\nCompleted detailed process design calculations for heat and mass transfer, and pressure drop for pumps.\nSpecified specialist equipment such as pumps, heat exchangers, mixers and valves to appropriate standard (determined by client requirements).\nInterfaced between software, electrical and project engineers to ensure successful project conclusion within project team.\nPrepared functional design specification, and agreeing with client over process operation, for software writing.\nEnsured all project work is to ISO 9001 standard and project lifecycle procedures.\nManaged and completed internal and external commissioning to agreed scope of project.\nMAJOR PROJECTS\nCornish Lithium Hydrometallurgy Demonstration Plant (value circa £5m)\t\tJune 2021 to Present\nRole: Technical/Contracts Manager\nA demonstration plant of more than 35 ‘skid’ units, capital items and services that combined together to form one large overall novel process in a greenfield site. The process was scaled-up system from a pilot plant developed by metallurgists in Australia used to extract lithium hydroxide from lithium mica.\nCompleted detailed specifications and schedules for completion of design FEED study in order to win project. This required the creation of several new AiPS standard documents due to the complex nature of the process.\nParticipation in HAZOP and LOPA assessments before management of all required design changes. Thus ensuring design scale-up was suitable for UK health and safety standards. Reviewing of costs to ensure that all required changes were accounted for in the proposed contract",
