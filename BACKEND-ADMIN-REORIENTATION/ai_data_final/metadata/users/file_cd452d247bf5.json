My duties are from \nthe promotion of the instrumentation towards the internal customer ( sales  reps and application specialist) \nand the external one (Hospitals, Private Analysis Laboratories), to the 360 -degree management of t he line \nand its equipment.  \nI am  involved in  forecast, sales analysis, and response  to tenders complex, preparation of marketing \nmaterial as an aid to sales and as scientific dissemination, follow -up clinical evaluations carried out  by kol.  \nIn addition to the CLIA, I also deal with the entire IFA and BLOT area, always with the same tasks.  \nIn 2020,  I also started following another instrumentation in eCLIA, so that I expanded my knowledge on \nchemiluminescence and on viral and clinical c hemistry markers.  \nGiven my scholar instruction  I am very interested in the instruments and their operation, I like to \nunderstand how the various instruments  work and how is possibl e improve them , both on the user \ninterfa ce and on the application side.  \nI strong believe that immunometry in CLIA  or eCLIA  is the future for Autoimmunity since the IFA presents \nmany critical issues, e specially in terms of expertise . \nI am very attracted to the possibility of working for an instrument manufacturer rather than  a distributor \nabove all to try to improve the product more and more to be able in the best way to satisfy the customer \nand the company for which I work. I would also like to give my contribution in improving the \ninstrumentation and meeting customer expect ations as much as possible, as well as developing new \nbusiness collaborations.  \n \n ",
