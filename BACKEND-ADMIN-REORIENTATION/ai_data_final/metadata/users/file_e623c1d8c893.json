Heating systems can be \ncommissioned any time from 1 April 2022, and a pplications \nfor grants opens from 2 3 May 2022. It has £450m funding \nconfirmed over three yea rs. \nReplacing your current  heating system with a heat pump will \nreduce your carbon foot print.\nA heat pump takes heat at a low temperature from the air or ground,  \nincreases that heat to a higher temperature and transfers it into your home to provide heating and hot water. Heat pumps are much more efficient than traditional boilers. \nBiomass boilers usually burn wood or wood pellets to deliver heating and hot \nwater to your home.\nYou can find more information on low carbon heating technologies on the \nSimple Energy Advice site: www.simpleenergyadvice.org.uk/your-home/heating-and-hot-water\nA qualified installer will be able to recommend which technology is most suitable for your property.\nGrant levels \n•Grants will reduce the upfront cost of installing a low carbon heating system.\n•£5,000 is available towards air source heat pumps and biomass boilers.\n•£6,000 is available towards ground source heat pumps.\n•We expect your installer to discount the value of the grant from the total costpaid by you, and include this in their quote.\nTo make the application for the scheme as simple as possible, it will be led by your chosen installer, with an opportunity for you to give consent that you are happy to proceed with the application.\nFinding an installer\nYour chosen installer will need to be certified by the Microgeneration Certification Scheme \n(MCS). MCS is a nationally recognised standards organisation that gives you assurance of the quality of your product and competence of your installer. It also means your installer complies with high consumer protection standards.\nIn line with most home improvements, you may want to obtain a quote from more \nthan one installer.\nYou can find an MCS certified installer in your area here: www.mcscertified.com/\nfind-an-installer/ \nWhat will your chosen installer do?\n•Apply to Ofgem, the scheme administrator,for a grant voucher.\n•Provide your details to Ofgem. Ofgem willemail you, asking you to consent to theinstaller applying on your behalf.\n•Complete the installation in line with industrystandards and scheme requirements.\n•Redeem the voucher and receive the grantfollowing installation and commissioning.\nEligibility \nYour installer will work with you to ensure that your property and technology meet the full range of eligibility requirements. These are the key requirements:\n•Homes and small non-domesticproperties in England and Wales willbe eligible. The maximum installationcapacity of up to 45kWth covers the vastmajority of these properties.\n•Your property will need a valid energyperformance certificate* with nooutstanding recommendations for loftor cavity wall insulation. This is becauseyour heating system will work moreefficiently with these insulation measuresin place. For further information anddetails of exceptions, please speak toyour installer.\n•Biomass boilers are only eligible inrural locations and in properties offthe gas grid.•Heat pumps are eligible either on or off \nthe gas grid.\n•The commissioning date of your low  \ncarbon heating system must be on or \nafter 1 April 2022.\n•You must be fully replacing an existing \nfossil fuel system such as oil, gas or  \ndirect electric. Funding will not be \navailable for the replacement of existing \nlow carbon heat systems.\n•New build homes and social housing will \nnot be eligible for the Boiler Upgrade \nScheme, although custom-build \nproperties will be eligible.\n* You can check to see if your home has an energy performance ce",
