This also included performing their annual appraisals.\nWork closely with many parts of the business such as quality and inspection to make sure that we are aware of any and all eventualities we may encounter during the installation and commissioning stages.\nKeeping safety as a priority worked alongside the EHS manager to create new risk assessments and method statements and implemented them into every job.\nDec 2012 to Mar 2017\nPosition: Mechanical Engineer\nProcess contracts and interpret the customer specification and needs, speak to customers directly to discuss/recommend parts that are needed, involving designing bespoke parts to fit the requirements.\nDeal with any problems with machines both on the shop floor and already in the field. This can range from simple problems where a part might need replacing to designing new parts that can be retrofitted to allow a machine to operate quicker.\nMaintain an active part within the Staff council (dealing with any employee concerns) The Environmental Committee (discuss and initiate projects that will impact positively on the environment).\nAug 2012 to Dec 2012 Denso Martin\nPosition: Production Engineer\nGet hands on with the machinery and talk to operators to discuss, test and implement improvements that will make the machine safer, easier or faster to operate.\nLiaise with the tool room and maintenance to make sure that the project can be completed efficiently and on time as well as making sure it is within budget.\nSelf-motivation was a key factor in the role as many projects will be initiated based on personal observation, but it was also important to discuss with other engineers, production staff, and technicians.\nCOMMENT\nA confident, adaptable and motivated individual with experience in both design and mechanical roles, excelling in many forms CAD, both 2D and 3D with a keen appreciation to details and learning new things.\nWith a friendly and approachable persona, he is able to assess and understand the needs of the task in hand and work with others or individua",
