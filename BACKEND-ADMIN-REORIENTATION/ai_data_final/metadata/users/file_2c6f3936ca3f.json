Actively checked progress and ensured safety actions from the hazard reviews \nare implemented efficiently and on time.  \n Create d SIL Assessments using the LOPA methodology to ensure company safety target is \nmet. S pecial focus on  overfill of  low pressure flat bottom storage tanks  (SIL 3 systems)  and \nroad tanker  loading operations  (overpressure and los s of containment).  \n Produce d a Quantified  Bow Tie Assessment to comply with the French national regulator for \na large Air Separation Unit. Answered all authority questions as required.  \n Evaluate d vent location by  simulating  discharge plumes  using PHAST DNV t o prevent \nasphyxiation and/or toxic exposure of personnel  to vented gases. This includes  heat radiation  \ncalculations  for jet fire releases  to ensure flammable vents are at safe heights.  \n Ensure d Packaged Gas Sites (cylinder loading plants with flammable gas es) are compliant \nwith ATEX and DSEA R regulations . \n Assist ed in interpretation of national/local Process Safety Regulatory  requirements for the \nregion where the plant is located .  \n Provide d process safety consulting support and recommend ed optimal solutions to \nEuropean wide Packaged Gas Facilities ensuring the management of change (MOC) system \nwas adequately followed as well as  following the guidance documentation of the European \n    \n  \n Industrial Gases Association (EIGA) . \n Chaired of the Retrofit Committee ensuring changes to Engineering Standards are discussed \nto identify which ones become mandatory retrofit actions for existing plants.  \n Devel oped global process safety standards, tools, programs, training courses, and work \nprocess  throughout my role.  \n Ensure safety i s maintained at a 6 ton/day Liquid Hydrogen Plant  by completing SIL \nAssessments using the LOPA methodology for the Liquid Hydrogen Storage Sphere and the \nLiquid Hydrogen Road Tanker Loading Bay.  \n Ensured plants are supported by troubleshooting and indentify ing process safety problems. \nEnsured problems and incidents are reported and resolved.  \n \n5 Sep 2016 - 4 Sep 2017  Process Systems Engineer - Global Engineering and Manufacturing   \n Responsibilities and accountabilities   \n Completed Site Work Instruction Manu als (operating manuals) for start -up, shutdown, \nemergency shutdown for large ASUs  \n Created change notes to modify P&IDs to meet customer requirements and internal \nEngineering S tandards  \n Lead the creation of a 50 ton/day Liquefier P&ID  \n Participated in HAZOPs ensuring actions are i mplemented in P&ID change notes  \n Created cause and effects diagrams for a 75,000 ton/day Oxygen and Nitrogen  ASU and for \n30,000 m3/day Helium plant  \n1 Sep 2015 - 5 Sep 2016  Process Engineer - European Operations  \n Responsibilities and accountabilities    \n Provided technical support to maintain operation of ASUs in United Kingdom  \n Trouble -shooting plant process issues by analysing data and developing solutions  \n Supervised change out of  molecular sieves for Thermal Swing Adsorbers  \n Created cha nge n",
