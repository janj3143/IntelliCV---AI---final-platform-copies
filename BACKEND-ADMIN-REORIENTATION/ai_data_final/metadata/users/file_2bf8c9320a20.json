A methodical and efficient approach was taken to accomplish all tasks within the strict timeline thus demanding outstanding project management throughout. Extensive problem solving was necessary to overcome computational errors and effectively optimise the model as well as adapting to unforeseen circumstances that arose. A culmination of all specialist knowledge of the subject was transcribed into a well communicated, meticulous scientific report.\nProfessional collaboration within the engineering department required effective communication for the completion of multiple group assignments; moreover, holding an influential role, remaining diplomatic and motivating team members at times of stress.\nIncreased skill level in engineering computational software performing multiple designs, simulations and analyses in a systematic format. Having no prior knowledge of each programme, great resilience was needed to successfully develop the skills to complete pre-set tasks and draft a professional research-style paper, presenting and discussing results obtained.\nTime spent at CATCH training facility led by Reynolds Training Services whereby Hazard and Operability studies were performed on site to appreciate the necessity for rigorous process safety. A what-if analysis was used when executing risk assessments in small focus groups, followed by a presentation of findings.\nNumerous laboratory classes provided visual applications of fundamental theoretical topics, while augmenting lab etiquette and procedures. Subsequently, report writing significantly enhanced analytical and written communication skills.\nAside from studying, time was spent participating in sport teams and societies. Mainly, representing the university in rugby union and as a member of the engineering society, entering the Frank Morton sports day event.\nSept 2014 – Jul 2016 \t\t\t\tA-Levels\t\t\t    Liverpool Life Sciences UTC\nChemistry\nMaths\nPhysics\nSept 2009 – Jul 2014 \t\t\t\t GCSEs\t\t   Christ The King Catholic High School\nNine GCSEs at grade A – C including English and Maths.\nSkills\nAdaptable\nDisciplined\nIndustrious\nInnovator\nMethodical\nProject management\nResilient\nTeamwork\nTechnical writing\nSoftware\nMicrosoft Office\nMicrosoft Visio\nMATLAB\nSimulink\nApp Designer\nANSYS Fluent\nAspen HYSYS\nCOMSOL Multiphysics\nWork Experience\n2014 – 2017; Jun 2020 – Present        Trainee uPVC Installation Specialist          M J McKettrick Joinery Services\nSupporting family business through hardships during global pandemic.\nWorking efficiently to complete domestic projects within time constraints.\nAssisting with installations, lifting framework safely, maintaining tools and active work area.\nLiaising with customers to ensure they were satisfied with work completed in line with contract agreed.\nFeb 2019 – Nov 2019\t\t\t\t   Waiter\t\t\t\t    Piccolo Italian Bistro\nGreeting and serving customers in a courteous manner.\nWorking efficiently and accurately while in a busy environment.\nRegular use of tills and handling of money.\nAttaining a good knowledge of evening menu including bi-weekly new specials.\nJun 2019 – Aug 201",
