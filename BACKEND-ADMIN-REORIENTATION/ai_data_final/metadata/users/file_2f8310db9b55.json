Now seeking a company that values profit and purpose. PROFILE\nRELEVANT EXPERIENCE\nHeimdal\nHeimdalBUSINESS DEVELOPMENT MANAGER\nHeimdal builds Direct Air Capture (DAC) facilities across the US. \nIn a generalist role that extended beyond conventional business\ndevelopment, I contributed to people management, strategy\ndevelopment, research & analysis and more (see page 2).\nFOUNDER’S ASSOCIATE / EXECUTIVE ASSISTANT\nInitially an operational role with increasing strategic involvement.\nUntil June 2023, Heimdal operated under the name 42AD, a\nsubsidiary focused on building a food automation solution.\nAfter prompting collaborative & transparent discussion on our food\nproduct, 42AD was closed and Heimdal returned to DAC. \nBio-Li SolutionsCHIEF OPERATING OFFICER (UNIVERSITY PROJECT)SKILLSDurham UniversityBSc NATURAL SCIENCES | First Class\nImperial College London MSc THEORETICAL PHYSICS | n/a First Class with Outstanding Achieve-\nment Award (>75%) in Year 1, 2 & 3\nTop score in ~30% (5/16) of all\nmodules taken in 2nd and 3rd year\nTop 3 in over 50% of modules\n(average class size ~100)\nYearly averages: 80, 78, 76 \nI made the decision to leave Imperial in\nYear 1 at the end of second term. 2019 - 2022\n2017 - 2018Jul 23 - Nov 23\nNov 22 - Jul 23 \nOct 21 - Jun 22 \nLed a team of 7, developing a plan to commercialise novel lithium-\nion battery recycling technology.\nI proactively built UK industry relationships to understand pain-\npoints and provide a needed solution, leading to a Carbon13 offer.OTHER EXPERIENCE\nPEOPLE MANAGEMENT In two instances, consulted by CEO(s) on colleagues’ futures, I advised\nredirecting their efforts to tasks aligning with their skills. The results: one  \ncolleague - an intern - created Heimdal’s current website, while another\nnow focuses on in-house skill development for crucial technology\nassessments. \nEXTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS Originated and drafted the initial op-ed released in Carbon Herald (Oct\n2023) to generate momentum for Heimdal's funding round and establish\nHeimdal as a thought leader. The piece prompted a follow-up in Semafor,\npositioning Heimdal in discussions with industry leaders Climeworks and\nHeirloom, and has already facilitated financing opportunities.\nSTRATEGIC CONNECTIONS\nMostly generated opportunities through networking and outreach, either\nleveraging existing networks, forging new direct relationships or indirect\nrelationships. Generated a pipeline of potential deals with injection well\npartners, as well as a pipeline of opportunities and ideas for the sale of\ncarbon credits alongside accompanying presentations.HEIMDAL EXPERIENCE\nIN DETAIL\nRESEARCH & ANALYSIS Completed three central research projects: 45Q, California-LCFS &\nregulatory compliance. Provided comprehensive 45Q insights through  \nresearch and expert discussion. Evaluated California-LCFS feasibility for\nshort-term revenue. Ensured compliance through cultivating a robust\nrelationship with the Oklahoma Dept. of Environmental Quality.\nContributor to central strategy development. Working closely with the CEO\n& lead engineering team, I drove & originated critical initiatives such as\nrevenue stream selection, personnel decisions, scaling strategy &\nstakeholder engagement. STRATEGY DEVELOPMENTForged strategic connections via targeted networking, connecting with key\nstakeholders like press channels (e.g., WSJ, Bloomberg), regulators (e.g.,\nCARB), and industry experts. Attended events independently, both\ndomestic and international. Also conducted targeted outreach and\nmeetings, overall contributing >10 unequivocally strategic connections. \nOPPORTUNITY GENERATION\n ",
