At the time he decided to remain with Rotex as the company had offered him a change in his role and he wanted to see how this worked out.\nThere seems to be some uncertainty in Rotex Europe at the moment, and when we met up with him recently, he expressed his interest in pursuing the opportunity again. Daniel used to work with Christian Niggemeyer (at Rotex) and they have remained in close contact since. Christian has given a positive endorsement of 3V Tech and this has strengthened Daniel’s interest.\nWe were very impressed with the way Daniel came across during our meeting with him and believe he would be a strong addition to the UK team.

He’s based in the North East of England but would be happy in a field-based travelling role across the UK and international. He finds the prospect of international work to be exciting and a change from his one-site focus at this moment.\nHe is familiar with 3V Tech equipment from his time at Fine Organics and is very interested in moving into a role which offers varied travel and long-term prospects.\nCurrent Salary: Approx. £42k after holidays and deductions\nCandidate 3 – Michael Wilson\nMechanical Maintenance Technician - Syngenta – Fife, Scotland\nOverview\nOver 20 years’ experience working in the manufacturing environment.
