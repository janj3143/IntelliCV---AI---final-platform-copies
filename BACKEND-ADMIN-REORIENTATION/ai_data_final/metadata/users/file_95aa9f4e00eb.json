Independently \nproduced deliverables for the detailed design of the fermentation unit and plant layout.  \n2006–2013  Macclesfield High School/ College  \n  A Level s – Mathematics (B), Chemistry (B), Biology (B)  \n  AS Level s – Product Design (B)  \n  GCSE s – 14 (2A*, 6A, 6B) including Maths and English  \nRelevant  Experience            \nAug 2019  – Present   Process  Engineer – Wood PLC  \nDeveloped my core process engineering competencies on two world scale FEED project s; designing \na Natural Gas Fractionation facility to be built in the Middle East  and a separate PMC role on a project  \nto design a n olefin complex in Belgium.   Currently d eveloping a company -wide framework for \nembedding  sustainab ility and reliab ility within  infrastructure projects.  \n• Performed process adequacy studies on two existing NGL fractionation facilities to process a \nchange in feed composition and capacity; developing pro cess simulations to benchmark \nagainst equipment design and identify inadequacies.  \n• Developed  and reviewed key engineering deliverables , such as; Basis of Design (BOD) , \nProcess Flow Diagrams ( PFD), Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams ( P&ID ) and Datasheets . \n• Performed several technology evaluation process  studies , including;  licensed sulphur removal \nunits  for various feeds  and a detailed  Spent Caustic Treatment Technology evaluation . \n• HAZOP scribed (remotely) for several different process areas , including license r units, \nproducing HAZOP reports and implementing outcome actions.  \n• Performed utility system configuration studies due to major reconfiguration of project scope.  \nSept 2017 – Aug 2019  Graduate Engineer – Affinity Water  \nGained valuable experience u ndertaking a range of  roles and projects within a graduate scheme.  \nProcess Optimisation P roject  \n• Lead a process optimisation project assessing  the performance of  a potable  water treatment \nsite in terms of operating costs, process and product quality.  Established a methodology that \nhas been adopted as the standard approach by other  optimisation engineers . \n• Produced a series of solutions to mitigate inefficiencies concerning p ower, product quality and \nwaste production, e.g. installing a bypass to reduce waste product and power usage.  \n• Performed process modelling through mass/flow balances to simulate scenarios to quantify \nsavings and understand the risk of identified potential  optimisation s. \n• Performed onsite tests (jar tests) to assess the performance of the sludge separating units \nand i nitiated a trial to assess a novel rotary sludge thickening unit to reduce waste volumes.  \n• Provided onsite technical support to operators continuing the maintenance of optimal settings.  \nHS2 Water Treatment Project  \n• Working on the design and installation of ultra-filtration treatment plants within the HS2  \nprocess  design team.  \n• Reviewing design drawings  and documents,  including P&IDs, PFDs , mass  balances and \ncontrol philosophies,  ensuring they comply with company standards.   \n• Performing hydraulic design calculations for pump sizing.  \nEnergy Strategy P roj",
