Gill Kernick Curriculum Vitae Profile An internationally experienced Strategic Consultant specialising in Safety, Culture and Leadership, with a track record of producing results through Intellectual Property Design, C-Suite Culture Change Strategy Delivery, Public Speaking and Coaching and Leadership Development. An agile, strategic thinker with the ability to operate at all levels of an organisation and across diverse cultures, bringing thought partnership to bespoke change interventions.  I partner with Multi-National Corporations to create sustainable change, focusing on building leadership and management capabilities in complex, high risk environments. My core belief is that developing and unlocking principle and values-based leadership capability is the key to sustainable culture change.   A passion is the prevention of major accidents. The key to understanding and mitigating against catastrophic risk demands the ability to lead and navigate systemic complexity. Core to this is valuing equality of life and equality of voice.  All lives matter and matter equally and all voices count.  Those with power must ensure all voices are heard.   I lived on the 21st Floor of Grenfell Tower from 2011 to 2014 and watched it burn. Seven of my former neighbours died, including Logan-Isaac, the youngest victim who was still-born.  I vowed to do what it takes to ensure we learn and to bring the thinking and learning from major accidents and speak and write to enable this. In 2020 I was publicly voted one of SHP’s top 25 most influential people in Health and Safety in the UK for this work and will be publishing a book Catastrophe & Systemic change in Q2 2021.  Authenticity, compassion and courage are cornerstone values. I'm passionate about creating trusting relationships between Executives and the Front Line, thereby unleashing discretionary effort and sustained impact on performance.   Clients include Centrica, Metro (Denmark), Shell, BP, Maersk Oil, Novo Nordisk, BHP Billiton and Biogen. My work has taken me all over the UK and Europe, and to Siberia, Mozambique, Algeria, Singapore, Malaysia, Australia and across North America. I live in London and adore travelling, working in and learning about new cultures.    \n\nGill Kernick, Curriculum Vitae, 2021 .
