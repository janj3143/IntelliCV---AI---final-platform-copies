Specifically, conducting fundamental and applied \nresearch on heterogeneous and homogeneous catalysts, adsorbents, and catal ytic \nprocesses, such as new chemical transformation to upgrade hydrocarbon \nfeedstocks. He is  a member of research teams that span multiple regions (Americas, \nEU, Asia) that are composed of interdisciplinary members (chemists, engineers, \nbusiness, marketing) . As an example of a research project, please see press release \nhttps://lnkd.in/euz -9hAP (catalyst and process development for propane \ndehydrogenation technologies).  \n \nOther tasks include: managing a group of approx. seven research technicians (MSc, \nBSc) on laboratory experimentation, spectroscopy and chromatography data \n    \ncollection, troubleshooting and SHE related training. Responsible for purchases of \nequipment and third party services, HAZOP assessments and post -implementation \n(training, method setup).  \n \nMarch 2017 to March 2019  Grillo -Werke AG, R&D Department, Chemical \nDivision  Duisburg, Germany  \nPosition:  Research Chemist  \nTasks: Study of the sulfonation of methane to methanesulfonic acid and recycling of \nfluorocarbons under superacid conditions; scale -up process to  a pilot plant setting; \nhandle corrosive and explosive mixtures; prepare patents and scientific publications.  \n \nMarch 2016 – March 2017  Hopperide Inc.; Ottawa, Canada  \nPosition: Start -up Co -founder  \nTasks: Implementation from zero -to-one of every aspect of a technol ogical start -up; \nbusiness development, software coding, financing, customer engagement, etc.  \n \n \nCOMMENT  \n \n \nCore Competencies  \n• Managing complex research projects (ideation, prioritization, execution), \ntranslating vision from business into research solutions, intellectua l property \ndrafting, pilot plant construction and operation (eg., reactors up to 4 gallons, \n120 barg, and 7.5 m distillation columns).  \n• Managing and training laboratory technicians in air -sensitive techniques, high -\nthroughput techniques, pressure reactors, vacuum distillations, handling highly \ncorrosive and explosive mixtures, reporting out data, and SHE trainings for \nnobody gets hurt policy.  \n• Expertise in data acquisition and interpretation of homogeneous and \nheterogeneous catalyst characterization (X -ray di ffraction, NMR, FT -IR, BET, \nSEM, TEM, etc), and catalytic process development and optimization (online \nGC, HPLC, NMR, etc).  \n• Inventor on eight patent applications and author of eight peer -reviewed \npublications. Over twenty three international conference pre sentations.  \n \nResearch Inter nships  \nAlexandre Martinez’s Research Group, ENS Lyon; France May 2015   \nR.
