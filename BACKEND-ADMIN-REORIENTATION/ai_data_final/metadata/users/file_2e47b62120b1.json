Commitment  and ethics  are my strongest  drivers.  \nThree  years  ago, I joined  a fast growing  Italian  multinational  company  at Corporate  level,  seizing  the chance  of being  an active  \npart of an ambitious  industrial  project,  and gaining  a wider  insight  of the Global  Market  dynamics.  \nAt DiaSorin  I took over the pre-launch  and launch  activities  of the LIAISON®  QuantiFERON® -TB Gold Plus solution,  enabling  \nthe worldwide  healthcare  systems  gain an easier  access  to Latent  TB testing,  a key compon ent of the Global  fight against  \ntuberculosis.  Through  this experience,  I also built my knowledge  on the added  value  of the T cell-mediated  cellular  immunity  \nin diagnostics , and understood  its potential  applications  in several  clinical  settings.  \nBeing  Oxford  Immunotec  at the cutting  edge  of the T cell-based  technology , I would  be proud  and excited  to contribute  to \nthe success  of this groundbreaking  project  with my experience  and willingness  to work.  \nLooking forward to exploring our possible future colla boration . \n \nSincerely yours  \nUgo Sottotetti  \n \n   Curriculum Vitae   Ugo SOTTOTETTI   \n  © European Union, 2002 -2018 | europass.cedefop.europa.eu  Page  2 / 4  \n \nPERSONAL INFORMATION  Ugo SOTTOTETTI  \n  \n  Via Monti, 47 20855 Lesmo (MB) , ITALY   \n +39 349 6538 764 (personal)  \n+39 347 7512  997 (business)  \n         \nugo.sottotetti@gmail.com  (personal)  \nugo.sottotetti@diasorin.it  (business)  \n \n https://www.linkedin.com/in/ugo -sottotetti -6b75a926/   \nDate of birth  06/02/1970  | Nationality  Italian  \n \nWORK EXPERIENCE  \n   \n POSITION  Global Head of Product Management  \nSep 2017 – Present  \n Senior Corporate Marketing Manager  LIAISON QuantiFERON  \nDiaSorin SpA – Saluggia ITALY  \nIn-vitro diagnostics  \n Manage lifecycle  activities for the QuantiFERON -based product  portfolio at Corporate level  \n Build, execute and follow -up Corporate Marketing Plan  \n Coordinat e joint-activities with  local sales organizations  and commercial partners to drive \nexecution and meet  the global sales targets  \n Provide s cientific  support and competitive update s across  the organization  \n Collaborate  with Product Development, Regulatory and QA departments to support local \nregistration processes and post -market surveillance  \n People in staff: 1 Corporate Marketing Project Manager  \n  \nJan 2014 – Aug 2017  National Sales Manager Specialized Sales and Blood Safety Solutions  \nRoche Diagnostics SpA – Monza ITALY  \n In-vitro diagnostics  \n Manage  National Specialized Sales F orce dedicated to high clinical value Immuno chemistry and M olecular  \nDiagnostics assays,  and innovative solutions .
