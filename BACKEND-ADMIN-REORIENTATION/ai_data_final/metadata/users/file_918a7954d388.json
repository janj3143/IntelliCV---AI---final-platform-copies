This required  \nme to identify the key requirements of the system an d ensure they could be quantified and were valid \nwithin the timeframe.  I then had to gain a technical understanding of helicopter control systems \nunderstanding how each control path would cause the system to react. The instability of the motion \nduring a co ntrol input could then be resolved using a series of feedback loops along each control \nchannel  using MATLAB . The system was then checked against military rotorcraft requirements to \nensure agile handling qualities to certify that the system met the initial system requirements.   \nTeamwor k \nHaving worked multiple customer service jobs, I am experienced in working as a team to deliver high \nservice standards in both retail and food services. These roles enabled me to develop clear \ncommunication skills and confide nce, dealing with both customers and other members of my team . \nExperience  \nApril 2019 - Present : Store Colleague, GO OUTDOORS  \n• Maintaining store standards  by constantly reviewing the condition of the shopfloor.  \n• Presenting  technical knowledge to custom ers about the products  sold instore . \n• Reorganized  the stock cupboard  by brand and gender  to greatly improve  service efficiency . \n \nJuly 2018 – October 2018: Chill ed Colleague , ASDA STORES LTD  \n• Picking stock from the storeroom and chillers to be taken to the shop floor.  \n• Effectively restocking the shelves on the shopfloor to ensure the shortest dates were sold first . \n• Working with other team members to complete shift t asks efficiently by catering to changing  \npriorities throughout the day.  \n \nJune 2017: Volunteer, GLOBAL VISION INTERNATIONAL NEPAL \n• Rejuvenating vario",
