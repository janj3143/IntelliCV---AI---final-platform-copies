I managed to secure a deal with Rockwell Automation whom appointed TSL as the only UK based training organisation accredited to deliver Rockwell Automation training courses to UK businesses. During first years trading I managed to secure training with the following companies: Premier Foods, Rolls-Royce, Gillette, AWE (Aldermaston), Unilever, Yokogawa and Coca-Cola, amongst others. The training spread covers all major automation brands: Rockwell, Siemens, Mitsubishi, In-Touch (Wonderware) & Schneider Electric. TSL’s accreditation and recognition can be seen in Rockwell sales collateral for 2010 & 2011 published schedules etc.\n\nIn November 2009 promoted to become Sales & Marketing Manager for the Tritec group. The Tritec group includes: TSL Training, Electron Systems, Tritec I.S. and Tritec Systems. Since taking up the challenge I’ve instigated a sales & marketing plan across the group which is now paying dividends. 2010 has the legacy of being our best trading year for 15 years or so with 2011 already beating this legacy with an increase of 32% over 2010’s business level. I now have a small but fast growing sales team (2 sales resources, 1 in the south & 1 in the north). I am responsible for setting their budgets & targets. I manage their activities with a hands-on approach adopting joint visits, setting target accounts & monitoring opportunities / projects. I have recently introduced a CRM to Tritec so that we are able to track & monitor activities, projects, opportunities, actions, wins & losses etc.\n\nWi",

I managed to secure a deal with Rockwell Automation whom appointed TSL as the only UK based training organisation accredited to deliver Rockwell Automation training courses to UK businesses. During first years trading I managed to secure training with the following companies: Premier Foods, Rolls-Royce, Gillette, AWE (Aldermaston), Unilever, Yokogawa and Coca-Cola, amongst others. The training spread covers all major automation brands: Rockwell, Siemens, Mitsubishi, In-Touch (Wonderware) & Schneider Electric. TSL’s accreditation and recognition can be seen in Rockwell sales collateral for 2010 & 2011 published schedules etc.\n\nIn November 2009 promoted to become Sales & Marketing Manager for the Tritec group. The Tritec group includes: TSL Training, Electron Systems, Tritec I.S. and Tritec Systems. Since taking up the challenge I’ve instigated a sales & marketing plan across the group which is now paying dividends. 2010 has the legacy of being our best trading year for 15 years or so with 2011 already beating this legacy with an increase of 32% over 2010’s business level. I now have a small but fast growing sales team (2 sales resources, 1 in the south & 1 in the north). I am responsible for setting their budgets & targets. I manage their activities with a hands-on approach adopting joint visits, setting target accounts & monitoring opportunities / projects. I have recently introduced a CRM to Tritec so that we are able to track & monitor activities, projects, opportunities, actions, wins & losses etc.\n\nWi",
