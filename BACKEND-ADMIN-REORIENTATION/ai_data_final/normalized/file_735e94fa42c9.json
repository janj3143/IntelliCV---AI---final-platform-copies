This has \nresulted in the presales role now having to develop into one that involves both technical ability \nand the capabili ty to have a CFO level conversation around consolidation cost benefit.  \n \nCloud Migration  \nCustomers across midmarket, SME and large Enterprise are realising the benefits that \nmoving to the cloud can potentially bring.  For many customers this can present a d aunting \nand unchartered territory preventing them from moving forward .  SE’s have a requirement to \nbe articulate allowing them to have that migration conversation with customers.  Being able to \npresent that journey from on -prem to cloud in a way that remov es any concerns for a \ncustomer is paramount in a world where cloud compute is prominent.  \n \nChannel Enablement  \nIn my previous two roles I have excelled at enabling partners from what was described as a \n“frozen territory”.  Partners were chosen on their techn ical ability and their ability to work as \nan SI and capability around solid and reliable delivery skills to customers.  My role was to \nensure that the partners were in a position to be able to have that technical conversation with \ncustomers to a high degre e.  Update sessions were held regularly to ensure that all partner \ninformation was up to date.   In the year following partner upskilling, seven figure targets were \nachieved.  \n \nCustomer and employment r eferences upon request.  \n \nHobbies /spare time  \n Cardiac First Responder for Sandpiper Wildcat  Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests  \n Regular fundraising for local charities through annual cycle sportive events  \n Mountain biking and road cycling  \n Hill walking  \nCURRICULUM VIT AE – CALUM AULD  \n  \n \n ",
