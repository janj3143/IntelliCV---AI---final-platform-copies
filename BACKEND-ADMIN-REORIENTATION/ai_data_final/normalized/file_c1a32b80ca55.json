Over this period of time I have successfully bought and sold three properties in the area of Lancashire. I have a keen eye for property and believe being involved in any aspects of buying and selling property should see me financially secure for the future.\nNow I have achieved my goal, I would like property to take a back seat as a hobby. I also have further ambitions to successfully run my own business in the future. I understand to achieve this ambition I need many more years’ experience to fully understand how a successful business is run and what it takes to build a successful team and working environment.\n3 Key achievements\nEnglish literature degree at Leeds Metropolitan University ; Level 2/1\n1 Kime street, Burnley  BB12 6RH\nThis property is a 2 bed end terrace and the first property that was renovated. When I purchased this property it was in poor condition, with the help of Wainwright Property solutions the property is now in great condition with a new occupant.\nI very much enjoyed my time working for LS1 Letting Agency in Leeds. I had learnt many key skills and it was there my ambition regards property increased.\nMay 2009- May 2010\nLS1 Letting Agency\n2 Cherry Tree Lane\nLeeds\nLS2 7AP\nLettings Negotiator –\n*Supassing sale targets\n*Negotiating Rental prices\n*Lead role in customer viewings\n*Very organised and innovative\nI very much enjoyed the hustle bustle of city living. I realised straight from day one that LS1 would be a great place for me to gain more sales experience. Had it not have been for personal reasons (moving back to Lancashire) I am sure I would still be working at LS1. I was extremely flattered when Mrs Judith Oliver – Director of LS1 offered me a fantastic position at M1 lettings agency their Manchester branch in a more senior role. I had however already made my decision to pursue a property buying ambition.\nSeptember 2007-February 2009\nGinger Ink and Hangeroom clothing stores.\nHeadingly, Chapel Allerton and Horsforth.\nLeeds.\nWhen studying for my degree for the duration of 4 years and residing in Leeds I decided to take on part-time work to keep myself familiar with the daily routine of hands on sales experience, so worked for this small chain of shops. It was a relaxed environment and I thoroughly enjoyed working there as there was a strong relationship between all the employees and the owners. I feel I am a great sales person, and loved the task of selling as many items a day as I could!\nKey Achievements:\nRelate to customers in a bid to make the individual feel comfortable\nMeeting sales expectations\nFamiliarizing my ability to operate in business\nShowed the ability to adapt in a new profession\nOctober 2004 – June 2005\nEndowment Compensation Assistance\nVantage House\nBuckshaw Court\nEuxton\nPR7 6TE\nI worked full time as an admin assistant at Endowment Compensation Assistance (ECA) during my gap year. They claim for the miss-selling of endowment mortgages. Whilst working there I was on the complaints team. It was our responsibility to issue the complaint letters to the insurance companies and to deal with their responses. We had to regularly talk to insurance firms and clients on the phone to answer queries regarding the cases. This could sometimes be quite difficult as the clients would often be quite anxious and the insurance companies irate. This role taught me a lot regarding customer service, and I got to see the company expand from 18 members of staff to around 50, which was interesting. I also went back there for a month in the summer to work and have been told by the managers I am welcome back at any time.\nEDUCATION\nEducation & Qualifications\n(2005 – 2009) Leeds Metropolitan University, Leeds\n2:1 in English Literature BA Hons.\n(2002 – 2004) Runshaw College, Leyland\nA  Levels:\nEnglish Language & Literature......B                          Fine Art.........
