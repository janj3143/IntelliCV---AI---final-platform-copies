After conducting a full analysis of each candidates’ strengths and weaknesses we now propose the following four candidates to be interviewed by 3V Tech.\nShortlist - UK\nDaniel Stockton\nJohn Taylor\nMichael Wilson\nRobert Galloway\nGiuseppe “Gino” Turri\nCandidate 1 – Daniel Stockton\nField Sales Engineer – Rotex Europe Ltd – Cheshire, UK\nOverview\n7 years’ experience working in the Process Equipment and maintenance sector, including mechanical field service support, installation and start-up technical support\nIndustries worked in include food & beverage, pharmaceutical and chemical markets worldwide\nDaniel has strong relevant experience in service, repairs, installation and commissioning of a range of bespoke process and materials handling equipment\nCurrently working at Rotex who manufacture a range of separation / screening equipment for pharma, food, chemicals sectors and he’s involved in the international Aftermarket team\nHe travels regularly both in the UK and internationally to the Middle East and Europe\n5 years’ service in the Royal Navy as a Marine Engineer, serving on a type 45 destroyer warship, as part of a 25-man strong team of skilled and versatile engineers\nQualifications include NVQ Level 3 in Engineering well as a full apprenticeship in engineering – both attained in the Royal Navy\nOur Thoughts\nDaniel was interviewed by Daniele during the last process last year and there was positive feedback. At the time he decided to remain with Rotex as the company had offered him a change in his role and he wanted to see how this worked out.\nThere seems to be some uncertainty in Rotex Europe at the moment, and when we met up with him recently, he expressed his interest in pursuing the opportunity again. Daniel used to work with Christian Niggemeyer (at Rotex) and they have remained in close contact since. Christian has given a positive endorsement of 3V Tech and this has strengthened Daniel’s interest.\nWe were very impressed with the way Daniel came across during our meeting with him and believe he would be a strong addition to the UK team. He is impressed by 3V’s product range and the company culture – he sees this as a more secure job and one he can learn more in.\nCurrent Salary:  £38,000 base salary\nCandidate 2 – John Taylor\nMechanical Maintenance Technician – Lucite International – Stockton on Tees, UK\nOverview\nCurrently a Rotating Equipment Technician at Lucite International which is a Top-Tier COMAH Chemical site – he services the rotating equipment in the production plant including inspections, condition monitoring, installations and commissioning etc.\nPreviously worked for 12 years at Fine Organics Ltd. another chemicals manufacturer. During this time, he gained proven experience with pressure filters, dryers and reactor systems.\nAt Fine Organics, he replaced some Pfaudler equipment with 3V Tech on recommendation from Peter Storey (who we understand has worked as a subcontractor for 3V previously)\nFirst-hand experience with equipment from Rosemund (DDPS), Heinkel, Thomas Broadbent, Flowserve and Chemineer\nHe has NVQ Levels 2 & 3 in Mechanical Engineering Maintenance and an NVQ Level 2 & 3 in Installing Pipe Work Systems\nOur Thoughts\nJohn has strong service and maintenance experience and a demonstrable problem-solving ability. He’s based in the North East of England but would be happy in a field-based travelling role across the UK and international. He finds the prospect of international work to be exciting and a change from his one-site focus at this moment.\nHe is familiar with 3V Tech equipment from his time at Fine Organics and is very interested in moving into a role which offers varied travel and long-term prospects.\nCurrent Salary: Approx. £42k after holidays and deductions\nCandidate 3 – Michael Wilson\nMechanical Maintenance Technician - Syngenta – Fife, Scotland\nOverview\nOver 20 years’ experience working in the manufacturing environment. Currently works on day to day maintenance i.e. oil levels, grease points, and general housekeeping of the plant to larger projects such as changing safety valves, bursting discs, flame traps, heat exchangers, pumps and gearboxes\nPreviously worked with companies who competed with 3V Tech – Pfaudler Balfour and Chemical Reactor Services (CRS) gaining first-hand experience with relevant process equipment such as glass lined reactors, centrifuges, pressure vessels etc.\nHe has a strong understanding of classic mechanical principles including hydraulics, pneumatics etc. combined with process engineering understanding as the equipment has been installed in process plants for chemicals, pharma, food sectors etc.\nCovered both UK and International sites in previous roles, with travel across the globe\nObtained a variety of certificates and completed various courses during career, including NVC Engineering and Machining level 3, and a National Certificate in Engineering Practice\nOur Thoughts\nMichael is currently working for Syngenta on one UK site as a Maintenance specialist. After 5 years, he is finding this role to be repetitive and is looking for a fresh challenge, as he very much enjoys the field sales environment. In his previous roles at CRS and Pfaudler Balfour he’s covered both UK and international countries including as far as China and Singapore. He was going to speak to his family about going back to a heavy travel-based role, but he believes it would be OK.\nCurrent salary: We found Michael to be a strong candidate for this role due to his extensive background and varied equipment experience. With that in mind, his further experience does take him a little over budget – he would be aiming for a salary in the region of £45/46K for a new position. Like John Taylor, he comes with a wealth of experience which would hopefully be taking into consideration with the slightly higher demands.\nCandidate 4 – Robert Galloway\nField Engineer / NVQ Assessor - Arch Chemicals – Hamilton, Scotland\nOverview\n20+ years’ experience in maintenance, including 10 in current role as Field Engineer / NVQ Assessor at Arch Chemicals\nStrong experience in a range hydraulic, pneumatic, mechanical and electrical disciplines working with process equipment including pumps, autoclaves, and a wide variety of valves\nInvolved in coaching and mentoring junior candidates and writing follow up reports. He also trains the company’s Modern Apprentice on the engineering principles.\nHas an SVQ Level 3 Process Engineering and has recently chosen to study for an HND / Foundation Degree in Mechanical Engineering with the Open University\nOur Thoughts\nRob has a strong background in servicing plant equipment and working with a wide range of process equipment through his time at Arch Chemical. His current official territory is Scotland (on paper) however he travels frequently around the UK, including Southern England as well as internationally in Scandinavia and wider Europe.\nHe has no issues with continuing the international focus as he is looking for more diversity where he can work across multiple sites with different equipment.\nCurrent salary: £34,000 base salary plus annual bonus (this ranges between 10% and 17% dependent on company performance) and he also gets a company van. Instead of overtime allowances, he accrues extra holidays in lieu but often he never has chance to use these due to the busy workload.\nCandidate 5 – Giuseppe “Gino” Turri\nEuropean Service Engineer – ADS Biotec – Paisley, Scotland\nOverview\nCurrently a European Service Engineer for ADS Biotec, a leading provider of specialist automatic and robotic devices / machinery for the biotechnology and life sciences industries, working heavily with robotics hydraulics and control systems\nHe works on assets with values ranging between £200,000 to £400,000 in his current role\nStrong mechanical and process engineering experience gained throughout career, working with a range of process equipment including filtration systems, centrifuges, decanters, and separators\nExperience across a variety of industries, including oils, energy, food and beverage, dairy and pharmaceutical\nHNC Mechanical Engineering qualified\nOur Thoughts\nGino possesses excellent communication and technical skills with a strong work ethic, coupled with a strong desire to succeed. He has described his natural aptitude for problem solving and how he thrives of challenging situations where he must find a solution.\nHe's currently doing 90% travel with him taking over 250 UK and European flights in the last calendar year alone. He would prefer a role with a better work life balance, but he’d still be happy with a 75:25 split in terms of travel to home working. He’s ideally looking for a long-term opportunity where he can excel in a progressive environment – he is keen to learn new things and he even talked about one day considering moving to Italy as he’s from an Italian family and speaks the language to a basic level already.\nCurrent salary: £44,000 base salar",
