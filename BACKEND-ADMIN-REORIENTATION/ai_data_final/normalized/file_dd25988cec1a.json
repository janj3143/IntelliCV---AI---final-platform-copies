Menarini is the first Italian pharmaceutical group in the world, it is present with its branches on most of the European territory and in the World. The A.

Purchasing Planning Manager HQ                                            Functional Rep.  Supply Chain Manager  My 2-year goal was to organize the planning and purchasing dept. for better purchasing and packaging. A team of two brought me back (one dedicated to the relationship with packaging contractors and the collection of forecasting data, and one dedicated to warehouse movements and inventories). My role was to critically analyze the data (Forecast, sales, stock and Back Order status of all the branches of the group) to establish the correct quantity of finished or semi-finished products to be purchased in order to ensure adequate coverage of stock. This analysis was carried out by MRP programs on AS400 and various comparison sheets created in Excel. My duties included stock monitoring, monitoring of contracts with suppliers, subcontractors and other group companies that carry out activities packaging; sending purchase forecasts and purchase orders to all suppliers of the A.Menarini diagnostics.  In two years of work thanks to the department we are managed to bring stocks back to adequate levels and to give a new way of working to packers ensuring less delay in deliveries of the finished material.
