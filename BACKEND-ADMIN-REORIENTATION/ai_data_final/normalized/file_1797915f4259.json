I am required to be up to date with all projects the company completed to appropriately advise contract managers and design engineers. During my time at AiPS, revenue more than tripled as the scale and complexity of projects significantly increased. As a result, my skills to handle multiple projects simultaneously grew exponentially. Main responsibilities include:\nDevelopment of PIDs and associated documentation, including detailed specifications, equipment schedules and process description documentation\nHAZOP and LOPA assessment participation as lead AiPS engineer.\nManaging design change requests from both internal and external sources including client and suppliers.\nAdvise and direct junior process engineers and design engineers on good engineering practices and relevant standards.\nDesign review and approval of PID, detailed design drawings, 3D models.\nTechnical support during construction and commissioning phase of large-scale projects.\nEnsure that work was completed to appropriate engineering standards, such as BS 60079 for ATEX installations\nMusk Process Services\t\t\t\t\t\t       \t\tSeptember 2018–July 2020\nJunior Process Engineer/Process Engineer\nI was responsible for complete process design from initial concept and quote with client through to detailed design and eventual commissioning upon project conclusion. Each project was based on a process improvement requirement from a client.\nDeveloped detailed P&IDs to suit client needs and requirements.\nCompleted detailed process design calculations for heat and mass transfer, and pressure drop for pumps.\nSpecified specialist equipment such as pumps, heat exchangers, mixers and valves to appropriate standard (determined by client requirements).\nInterfaced between software, electrical and project engineers to ensure successful project conclusion within project team.\nPrepared functional design specification, and agreeing with client over process operation, for software writing.\nEnsured all project work is to ISO 9001 standard and project lifecycle procedures.\nManaged and completed internal and external commissioning to agreed scope of project.\nMAJOR PROJECTS\nCornish Lithium Hydrometallurgy Demonstration Plant (value circa £5m)\t\tJune 2021 to Present\nRole: Technical/Contracts Manager\nA demonstration plant of more than 35 ‘skid’ units, capital items and services that combined together to form one large overall novel process in a greenfield site. The process was scaled-up system from a pilot plant developed by metallurgists in Australia used to extract lithium hydroxide from lithium mica.\nCompleted detailed specifications and schedules for completion of design FEED study in order to win project. This required the creation of several new AiPS standard documents due to the complex nature of the process.\nParticipation in HAZOP and LOPA assessments before management of all required design changes. Thus ensuring design scale-up was suitable for UK health and safety standards. Reviewing of costs to ensure that all required changes were accounted for in the proposed contract amendments.\nMain point of contact for all design-related enquiries and lead for biweekly contract meetings to review progress.\nCompleted process description document to successfully describe the complex process to the software subcontractor.\nManagement of detailed design progress and review of status to match challenging schedule.\nManaged procurement of all process equipment required to construct plant. Procurement value all completed to significantly below target costs.\nThornton & Ross New Batch Cooling System (value circa £400k)\t\t\tMarch 2021 to June 2022\nRole: Technical Manager\nIntegration of brand new air-blown cooler system reducing cooling times from 24 hours to 6 hours and reducing water wastage.  Design was future-proofed to BS EN 60079:10 for ATEX installations.\nCompleted detailed calculations of cooling times and chiller requirements. Worked alongside the client to reduce scope of contract when calculations determined initially agreed targets weren’t physically possible.\nSite survey of existing equipment/vessels and development of detailed PID to suit client requirements.\nPresentation of design concepts to client and agreed contract scope.\nReview of site installation and hydraulics around modifications to existing steam supply system.\nBakkavor Desserts Cream, Custard and Jelly Projects (value circa £2m)\t \tSeptember 2018–March 2020\nRole: Junior Process Engineer and Process Engineer\nA multistage project that expanded capacity whilst improving quality and introducing a new clean-in-place system within a hygienic environment.\nManaged orders on critical process equipment to complement project schedule.\nPrepared commissioning documentation and risk assessment.\nAssisted and eventually managed commissioning ensuring client scope met to project schedule.\nContinuously checked install and provided any assistance to pipework fitters and electricians on site that was necessary. Ensure that hygienic standards are maintained throughout the plant during installation.\nOther project examples with significant involvement\nVil Resins Tank Farm (value circa £2m) – A non-flammable storage tank farm with capacity for 360,000L of raw materials. Construction to be completed Q4 2024\nItac Adhesives DSEAR Report – Completion of a site survey and subsequent DSEAR report of existing plant.\nH2O Innovation FEED Study – Design study of concept for new polymer reactor facility. Scaled up version of a small existing plant in the USA.\nAlcohols Ltd (value circa £16m) – A greenfield site used to for the production of solvents blends and gin distillation. Circa 25 90,000L storage tanks were installed into a bund designed in accordance with CIRIA C376 and HSG176.\nOTHER EXPERIENCE\nUniversity of Nottingham Softball and Baseball\t\t\t\t\t2014-2018\nSoftball Captain/Head Coach 2015-16\nGeneral Secretary 2017-18\nOTHER SKILLS AND ATTRIBUTES\nHandling of multiple projects simultaneously, in various different fields and industries working to different standards.\nDifferentiating communication depending on different parties experience, knowledge bases.\nAssociate Member of the IChemE in the process of completing chartership application.\nCompetent with Microsoft Office – in particular Excel.\nAutoCAD LT proficient and Plant 3D literate.\nDriving License – full and clean.\nFor further information please contact Jan Johnston on 01695 570 696 or email janj@johnston-vere.co.uk ",
