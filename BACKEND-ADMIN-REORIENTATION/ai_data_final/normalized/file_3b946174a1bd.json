Focusing on driving world class manufacturing operations, agile systems, and continuous improvement within a matrix structure. During this role I have started my Black Belt Apprenticeship.\nLean Implementation: Created, implemented, and governed the Short Interval Control (SIC) and tiered review meetings in the Value Stream. Driving improvements through data analysis, quick wins, and problem-solving methodologies. She developed the root cause analysis process and documentation for the Bakery including the training and mentoring of Shift Managers, Engineers and supporting functions on the tool pack.\nBusiness Improvements: Worked across business functions to identify improvements within their processes, this helped to build the continuous improvement culture in non-production areas of the business; redesigned the complaints process and reports with the Technical team to allow clear areas of focus to be identified.\nData Analysis: Used her data analysis skills to diagnose and analyse production and financial data to identify and prioritise key projects.\nJan 2018 – Jan 2020 Ornua Ingredients UK\nPosition: Continuous Improvement Lead\nFood Processing / Ingredients.\nCI Lead, initially for one site then expanded my responsibilities, across two cheese processing facilities and managed the operation trainers at both sites. Focused on efficiency improvement projects, waste reduction and leading sites on their journey to Operational Excellence.\nEfficiency Improvements: Led the Kaizen workshops and facilitated the Green Belt and White Belt projects at a production site which resulted in an increase in OEE of 9% in 2018, alongside an uplift in run rate resulting in a 24% reduction in labour hours per tonne. Leading the site to achieve £250k of Savings against target of £189k per annum, which was celebrated with a planned shutdown and outside catering for the whole site.\nData Analysis: Standardised data analysis and reporting across Global Ornua Ingredients business and identified as the key contact for reporting through Tableau software. Allowing the SLT to have direct comparison between six manufacturing facilities and providing the business with visibility of the capacity opportunities.\nLean Implementation: Developed Short Interval Control and Daily Operations reporting and structure across manufacturing facilities, including simplifying the process to determine production targets in a complex environment with over 20 SKUs per line per day. Mentored two management team peers to achieve their Green Belt certifications. Introduced controlled methods of sample production and new product set up working with commercial and sales teams to ensure ease of use alongside technical and master data requirements.\nSep 2015 – Jan 2018 3M – Aycliffe / Loughborough\nPharmaceutical / Manufacturing.\nDec 2016 – Jan 2018\nPosition: Manufacturing Technology Engineer – Aycliffe Site\nWorked as the main production support engineer concentrating on process improvement, waste reduction and machine introduction projects within a $36MM/year capacity constrained business.\nMachine Qualification: Led the commissioning and qualification of a new injection moulder with integrated robotics; including process optimisation, recipe sequencing, SOP creation and training of maintenance and operations staff. Led training and process optimisation during production line insourcing to increase output by over 40% in three months.\nData Analysis: Used her statistical background and process knowledge to design, trial and implement a 7-week multi variable analysis from raw material characteristics and storage conditions, production settings to finished product performance. This process understanding study and her analysis has been used to increase the robustness of current products and enable the launch of a new product range.\nMay 2016 – Dec 2016\nPosition: Graduate Engineer – Loughborough Site\nBroadening her pharmaceutical experience, she moved to be part of the team commissioning and qualification of a new $23MM inhalation production line in a GMP environment.\nFacility Qualification: Managed the qualification of the facilities including writing validation documentation, coordination of facility classification testing and analysis of results.\nLean Six Sigma: Used her Green Belt training to assess and improve the efficiency in the new production facility, creating material flow procedures and implementing lean methodologies to maximise line output.\nChange Control: Decommissioned existing equipment, including gaining approval from the global business and planning safe deconstruction and removal within an ATEX environment. Supported SAP introduction to the site.\nSep 2016 – May 2016\nPosition: Graduate Engineer – Aycliffe Site\nJoined 3M’s optimised operations graduate scheme concentrating on projects that both produced area savings and reduced pain points for operators.\nProcess Improvements: Reduced operator intervention to replenish raw materials by 40% which also gave $16k waste savings. Generated and performed a design of experiments to assess and optimise output without compromising quality leading to a 4% increase in output on a capacity constrained line.\nPrioritisation: Developed several solutions to reduce waste on a production line, using a six-sigma prioritisation matrix to gain capital funding to replace a pneumatic station with servo drives.\nJul – Aug 2014 Summer Vacation Placement, ExxonMobil – Fawley\nJul 2012 – Jul 2013 Industrial Placement, GSK – Barnard Castle\nWorked in a technical team supporting troubleshooting activities, new product introductions, material characterisations, process, and material changes. Worked on a site wide project rationalising recipes and bills of materials used in the SAP system.\nCOMMENT\nShe is an enthusiastic individual who is keen to develop in a Continuous / Process Improvement focused role. Her experience in varying manufacturing facilities has given her the confidence that she can adapt quickly to new challenges and work across business groups. Her strong interpersonal skills, eagerness to succeed, and conscientious approach allows her to fit well into teams and lead sites on their continuous improvement journeys.\nKey Skills:\nShe believes her strengths lie in both her ability to build rapport quickly within teams through open communication and her technical skills that have allowed her to adapt and thrive in new situations.\nCollaboration\nCommunication\nData Analysis\nLean Implementation\nMentoring\nPrioritisation\nKey Achievements:\nHighest week output of 2.5million loaves surpassed during Covid.\nLed site to achieve £250k of Savings against target of £189k per annum.\nMentored two management team peers to achieve their Green Belt certifications.\nDesigned and implemented 7-week multi variable analysis to enable $36MM platform upgrade.\nLed process optimisation of insourced packaging line.\nFor further information please contact David Beeston on 01695 570 696 or email davidb@johnston-vere.co.uk ",
