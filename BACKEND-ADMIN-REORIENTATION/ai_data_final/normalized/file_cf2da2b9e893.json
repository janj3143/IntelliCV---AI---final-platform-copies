CV only analyzed\"\n\n6. 🔒 Security / Lint / GDPR\n   - Security architecture scaffolded\n   - Code linting tools: ruff, mypy, bandit, pre-commit integrated\n   - Compliance hooks for future opt-in logging, GDPR data traceability, cloudflare protections\n\n7. 📁 File Structure Alignment\n   - Reorganized filepaths:\n     - Backend: `backend/app/`, `backend/core/`, `backend/services/`\n     - Frontend: `frontend/dashboard_app.py`\n     - Data: `data/user_resume.txt`, `data/job_description.txt`\n     - Output: `output/match_analysis.json`, `output/tuned_cv_recommendations.json`, `output/role_fit_chart.png`\n\n8. 🚧 Testing + Debugging\n   - Real-time error handling added to backend scripts\n   - Dependency resolution scripting via `install_validate.py`\n   - Consistency enforced across `cv_matcher`, `cv_tuner`, and radar modules\n   \n9. 🗃️ Project Documentation Prep\n   - Planning to compile all phases (1–6.8) into a timeline-locked format\n   - Phase 6.8 marked as complete before GitHub push prep\n\nAll this activity precedes the point where a formalized development roadmap (timeline format) was introduced and locked into the project canvas.\n\n ",
