This involved:  \n1. Determination and analysis of the size distribution  of the food types following processing through an FWD. \n2. Use of an agitator to analyse the shear stress at which the produced flocs break up and to identify if the flocs \nwill break up in sewer systems.  \n3. Use of a filtration method to find the size to w hich flocs had broken up and to show which food types still had \nthe potential to cause blockages in sewer pipework.  \n \nThis project proved his ability to in -detail run a project from start to finish. He has the independence to complete \nan in -depth research r eport to a high -quality standard highlighting his technical abilities and independent lab \nwork skills.  \n \n \nCAREER SUMMARY  \n \nFeb 2020  to date  Present Company  \nPosition: Manufacturing Improvement Coordinator  \nHe began his role in manufacturing improvement in the compan y’s Manufacturing Excellence Team in February \n2020. He very quickly showed his ability to step up to the wide range of c hallenges he faced at the site which has \nonly recently been taken over by  the company .  \n• He has been able to engage and communicate successfully with many different people and demonstrated this \nto be one of his biggest strengths. He ha s had several  opportunities to use his technical skills in waste \nimprovement projects and has quickly showed that he was a valuable addition to the team and the site.  \n• He collated data on ingredients and waste which allowed him to combine yield, cost and volume th roughput to \nprioritise the most valuable ingredients, with biggest potential savings, for improvement focus.  \n• He w as involved in a broccoli waste reduction project which targeted  the reduction in floor waste produced. \nThese projects generated significant sa vings helping the team to regularly beat the weekly target by a \nconsiderable margin.  \n• He has worked on data gathering and analysis for capital projects to identify trends and to predict potential \nsavings and payback periods. He has investigated project risks and ho w to mitigate these.  \n \n \n \n \n  \nIndustrial Placement Experience:  \n \nInovyn, Runcorn Site  (Jun 2017, Jul & Aug 2018)  \nHe collected and analysed data on the cooling water flowrates proving which heat exchangers needed to be \nreplaced due to inefficiencies for the process team.  \n \nIn 2018 he returned to Inovyn for a full summer placement. As part of the project teams he complete d and led his \nown project to research the feasibility of a hydrogen purification project to produce fuel cell grade hydrogen to sell \nto local borough councils as a fuel for buses. He communicated with vendors to produce quotes for the purification \nunit, co mpressors and drier, produced a mass balance of the system, a Process Flow Diagram and a cost estimate \nbased on Lang Factors. He put into practice and further developed many of the technical and leadership skills learnt \nfrom his 3rd year design project. He finished the project in the allocated time slot and delivered the results by \npresentation to the senior leadership team.  \n \nHe took part in a commercial project, performed pressure relief valve calculations, audits and basis of safety training \nactivities a nd successfully juggled the high workload and deadline pressures. He has  experience in this high hazard \nchemical plant and ha s reviewed HAZOP documents, permit to work documents and COMAH case documents. \nThe skills he showed were the ability to balance his time effectively and  deliver well rounded and completed results.  \n \nVoluntary Experience:  \n \nBritish Heart Foundation, Sale  (Nov 2019 – Jan 2020)  \n \nUniversity of Sheffield Research Work, Sheffield (June – Aug 2019)  \nHe returned to the lab as a paid researcher following his Masters  degree research project investigation into cheese \nand bread to perform more tests for the team. He had tight deadlines and successfully recorded data for 5 more \nfood types over the summer period meeting my target. This research will be compiled with other  data in a PhD \nthesis report on the topic.  \n \nEngineering Without Borders Outreach, Sheffield (2019)  \nIn 2019 he led a number of outreach days going into schools to raise awareness of current global issues which can \nbe solved by engineering.  \n \nEDT Headstart (Jul 2017, Jul 2018, Jul & Aug 2019)  \nIn 2014 he was selected to take part in a 4 day engineering course at Sheffield University involving lectures and \nteam activities related to six of the main disciplines of engineering. He has returned to EDT  as a Supervisor for 5 \nHeadstart courses, leading and supervising up to 40 school children for up to 5 days. He is working towards \ncompleting the EDT mentorship qualification.  \n \nEde & Ravenscroft – Graduation Services (Jul 2019)  \nHe worked for Ede and Raven scroft the gowning and photography services in July 2019 at Sheffield University.  \n \nChatsworth Flower Show (Jun 2017 & Jun 2018)  \nHe worked in hospitality in a champagne and seafood restaurant.  \n \nCOMMENT  \n \nAn MEng  graduate  from the University of Sheffield achieving a 2:1 in his MEng degree course in Chemical \nEngineering. He is a highly motivated person. One of his strong est skills is his ability to interact well with people \nand lead teams. Problem solving is a key skill of his and he is focused on driving things to a successful completion \nin all aspects of his life. He performs well under pressure and contributes positive ly to a working environment. He \nhas a hunger to learn and to overcome challenges. He has proven his resilience and ability to thrive in a wide range \nof roles and experiences and believes he could perform at a high level in a wide range of situations and wo rking \n environments. When looking for job roles he is seeking a role which can help him develop further in the early stages \nof his career.  \n \nOther Qualifications & skills:  \n• Use of Matlab; Aspen Plus  \n• Full UK Driving Licence  \n \nAwards:  \nHe achieved the final of t he TARGETjobs - E.ON Engineering Undergraduate of the Year award based on his \nachievements, interviews and a selection process recognising his efforts academically and as a well -rounded and \nsuccessful individual.  (April 2018)  \n \nHobbies:   \nHe is a keen sports man previous completing a duathlon and regularly taking part in long distance fell runs some of \nwhich are of marathon distance. He also sport climbs, training to take part in trips abroad and round the country. \nHis success in these sports also relates to a ll aspects of his life and shows his perseverance and ability to push \nhimself and achieve the goals he set however much work is required.  \n \nFor further information please contact David Beeston  on 01695 570 696  or email  davidb@johnston -vere.co.uk   \n \n \n \n ",
