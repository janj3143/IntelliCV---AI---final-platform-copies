I represent  UK Site Safety as  the responsible final approver of all safety \nassessments for Pfizer API chemical processes (80% of Pfizer’s Total  Drug Portfolio) entering the s ate-\nof-the-art £100mil pilot plant facility  (e.g. COVID  Paxlovid) . As a Process Safety Lead er I provide \nconsultation  and evaluations to all plant change s and ensure that procedures are adhered to . \nAs leader of a team, I rely on skilled matrix management techniques  to d rive operational process  \nimprovement and implementation  throughout manufactur ing. I have reduced time spent on transfer  \nassessments b y 20% and have targeted scheduling bottlenecks to increase availability and throughput \nof the facility  by streamlining procedures and delivering training courses to influence choices and so \nreduce process ing hazards . I lead  multi -functional teams throughout daily operatio ns whether it be \nleading a procedural /equipment  change, Chairing  a HAZOP , Implementing G overnment Guidance or \nLeading the facility EHS Committee where I drive a positive safety culture through communication and \neducation.  \nProduction Engineer ( IQE Advanced Semiconductor Manufacture, 2019 – 2019)  \nLeading production/operational improvements  by implementing LEAN continuous improvement \nmethodology . Reducing product loss during manufac turing by identifying failure modes and \nimplementing improvement actions.  As a lead investigator of incidents,  I implemented many \ninvestigation techniques to identify incident root cause s (e.g. 5 Whys, Fish Bone) . I drove  positive \nchange from  shop floor lev el to management level using educational techniques to standardise  and \nsustain  improvements . \nProcess Engineer ( AVARA Pharmaceutical Services, 201 7 – 2019 ) \nAs SME Process Engineer at  an Upper  Tier COMAH Site  Manufacturing  Active Pharmaceutical \nIngredients  I was heavily involved in Chemical Engineering Design . Regularly delivering detailed \nmanufacturing support and proactively identifying solutions to processing issues  – including d esign, \ncommissioning and evaluation of plant s, seeking to introduce new technologies  that would  meeting  \nbusiness manufacturing needs . Applying  practical, experimental and theoretical C hemical /Process  \nEngineering skills and knowledge to identify optimum mechanisms and technologies for delivering \noutc omes  (e.g. Sizing Pumps, Relief Devices, Environmental Release Scenarios) . \n \nProcess Engineer/Project Leader ( Northwood & WEPA Paper Mill, 2016 – 2017 ) \nAs an Engineer within a heavy industry FMCG sector of paper manufacturing , I actively  sought  to \ndriving and investigating continuous improvement by  development of processing equipment and \nhuman resources.  Most significantly, I identified and implemented  £1million per year savings by \nleading a wastage  assessment of processing materials  and workflows.   \nMasters Level Industrial Placement  (Northwood & WEPA Paper Mill, 2015  – 2016 )  \n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nAcademic Qualifications  and Training  \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  \nIChemE Chartership , CEng Accreditation 2022 \n2012 – 2016 – Master Level Chemical Engineering, MEng –  Swansea University  \nAccredited  Training Courses  \n • HAZOP Leadership & Management, IChem E \n• Managing Conflict and Difficult Conversations, UCan  \n• Process Safety Management Foundations, Cogent  \n• Human Factors in Health and Safety, IChemE  • Layers of Protection Analysis, IChemE  \n• Hazards 30, IChemE  \n• Pressure Relief Sizing, ABB  \n• Risk Assessment Training, ROSPA  \n• Hazardous Area Classification, ABB   \n ",
