A high level of competency in chemical and process engineering due to experience from working in the industry and from academic study. Proven to be skilled in technical problem-solving and task prioritisation. Enthusiastic and fast learner with a passion for broadening knowledge and skills in the engineering field. Passionate about leaving a positive impact through my work and keen to have opportunities for challenging and engaging careers.\n02-2021 – Present     \tPROCESS ENGINEER\nDiodes Zetex Semiconductors Ltd, Oldham\nThe role involves developing, maintaining, and assisting wafer fabrication processes through competent use of Novellus PECVD technology, metrology, software, and endpointing systems.\nRequired to be efficient in complicated problem-solving via investigation and trial work in order to optimise the process of wafer fabrication and ensure product quality and efficiency of fabrication.\nCollaborating and communicating clearly with multiple departments: with the production line and equipment maintenance engineers to ensure all company departments are working together to maximise the efficiency and quality of production.\nWriting accessible, accurate and detailed step-by-step specifications for processes involved in various aspects of wafer-fabrication production for other people to follow.\nCurating and presenting data every month to colleagues and managers for Statistical Process Control reviews. The data presented involves detailed overviews of ongoing issues, investigative trials and resolutions to problems which have maximised production efficiency; what has proven successful and what could be improved upon.\nTraining colleagues and new operators in various aspects of wafer fabrication production.\nWhilst in this role gained the qualification of COSHH & Risk Assessor.\n09-2019-08-2020      \tMASTERS FINAL YEAR PROJECT\nCore Additive Technologies, Chester; University of Chester\nThe project involved investigating corrosion inhibitors in the oil industry, working alongside Core Additive Technologies.\nInvestigated the efficacy of various corrosion inhibitors used in the oil industry by trialling the work of multiple acids and parameters that affect steel corrosion such as temperature, flow, and pressure.\nDesigned and created my own functional rig operation for the trial work of the investigation.\nThe data collected during this project proved beneficial to the expansion of the company’s range of cleaning and remediation solutions.\n04-2018-08-2018      \tMODULE PLACEMENT IN THE BIO-DIESEL SECTOR\nOlleco, Liverpool\nThe placement saw me working under a Chemical Engineer and alongside multiple science and engineering professionals in the bio-diesel sector of the refinery, gaining knowledge and understanding of how the plant process ran on a daily basis and assisting the company with various essential processes.\nAssisted in the project of an addition of a double pass heater exchanger to the main process. This increased my competency and efficiency in bursting disc calculations, HAZOPS, MOCs, and isometrics.\nPerformed daily lab readings including oxygen demand, NH4 levels, and total suspended solids of samples in tanks.\nWorked here for the pre-planned 5-week university module placement followed by an additional three months of work due to the proficiency, enthusiasm, and work ethic displayed whilst on placement.\n2014-2018               \tCHEF\nYeung Xing Takeaway, Burnley\nThe role required me to prepare food for a busy takeaway to a high standard. This required me to be a fast worker with the ability to keep a clean and safe work environment, as well as requiring a degree of physical strength and capability.\nWorked part-time during high school and college, after school and on weekends, requiring me to have good time management and an excellent work ethic from a young age.\nEDUCATION AND QUALIFICATIONS:\n2016-2020               \tMENG CHEMICAL ENGINEERING\nUniversity of Chester.   Grade: 2:1\nModules included: Nuclear Technology and Environmental Engineering, Pharmaceutical and Food Engineering, Process Modelling, Project Management, Renewable Energy, Sustainability and Low Carbon Technologies, Process Design Principles.\n2014-2016               \tA-LEVELS\nBurnley College, Burnley\nMathematics: B, Chemistry: C, Physics: D, Environmental Science (AS): C.\n2009-2014:               \tGCSEs\nThe Swinton High School, Manchester\n13 GCSEs A*-C including: Mathematics: A, Further Maths: C, Double Science: A, Chinese (Cantonese): A, English Language: C, English Literature: B, Business Studies: Merit.\nRELEVANT PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES:\nThe production of a third-year undergraduate group dissertation piece on the production of Ammonium Nitrate fertiliser with CF Fertilisers from scratch with guidance of project supervisor. Continuation of project via an individually produced dissertation piece focussed on the multistage-Compressor and Expander design section within the process. ",
