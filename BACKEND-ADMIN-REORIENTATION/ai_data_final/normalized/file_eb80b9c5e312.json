PetroSIM was used as a simulation tool for \nthis feasibility study. He was an integral part of this transformation with estimated margin uplift \nof 20+ MM$/year.  \n• Developed effective fractionator tuning and product blending t echniques to improve the cetane \nnumber of hydrocracked diesel to improve sales volume of premium diesel by 50%.  \n• First Hydrocracker Engineer who implemented pilot plant test for hydrocracking catalyst \nselection with execution and interpretation methodolog y developed. hte GmbH was selected as \nan independent pilot plant testing company. This practice is now the new standard for modern \nhydrocracking catalyst selection in PTTGC.  \n• Modified hydrocracker fractionator so it can additionally recover 2% more heavy naphtha (if \nrequired).  \n• Leaded major projects, from basic to detailed design, such as:  \n1. Diesel rundown capacity debottleneck, 20% additional diesel draw  \n2. Hydrocracker feed preheating, 10 degC additional feed temperature  \n3. Wash water capacity debottle neck, 30% additional wash water to the problematic area  \n4. CDU overhead compression debottlenecking with estimated fuel saving by 2% at the \ncrude heater.  \n \nPower Plant and Utilities  \nKey achievements:  \n• Gas turbine downtime reduction by 50% by air filter upgr ading.  \n• Water transfer system design and water management plan to handle water crisis in Map Ta \nPhut area.  \n• Major reliability improvement of utility systems.  \n \nJuly 2012 – December 2012 Foster Wheeler, Chonburi, Thailand  \nPosition : Process Design Engineer  \nResponsi bilities:  \n Was part of a design team to develop Basic Engineering Package (BEP) of natural gas compression \nsystem and LPG recovery plant, both for Chevron Bangladesh.  \n \n \nCOMMENT  \n \nNattapong is an experienced chemical engineer with expertise in refining technologies and industrial \ncatalysis.  \n \nHe was recently part of Honeywell UOP's Field Operating Services (FOS) team with the primary focus \non hydroprocessing technologies. As a Senior Technical Advisor, he provided global technical support \nof new process unit start -ups, turnarounds, revamps, troubleshooting, and optimization across a range \nof refining and petrochemical technologies.  \n \nDue to Covid -19 and travel restrictions, his technical  service department in Malaysia was dissolved, so \nhe is now working as an independent consultant.  \n \nBefore Honeywell UOP, he held various roles in the refining and petrochemical industry in Thailand, \nwith most of his time in major companies like PTT Global C hemical and SCG Chemicals.  \n \nFor further information please contact Julie Smith  on 01695 570 696  or email Julie. smith @johnston -\nvere.co.uk  \n \n \n ",
