Owing to both coronavirus \nand the budget reviews at the Environment Agency this internship was unfortunately cancelled.  \n \nSummer 2018 and 2019  Tesco Exp ress \nPosition: Retail Assistan t \nWorked for two months in a Tesco Express store in Poole. Gained new skills in dealing with customers \nand being a helpful and friendly as sistant to members of the public. Also provided experience in retail \nand an understanding of working as part of a team in a workplace.  \n \n Summer 2016  Amherst School  \nPosition: Learning Support Assistant  \nVolunteered at Amherst School, Kent, as a learning support assistant which involved working in a Year \n5 classroom helping pupils with work as well as miscellaneous tasks  to keep the school running \nsmoothly. Had to use my initiative to complete new tasks given to me.  \n \nMay 2015 Sony PlayStation  \nPosition : Marketin g Team  \nWriting reports on how the press reacted to new game releases, gained valuable experience by \nworking as a team, as well as a taste for working in an office environment. Took responsibility for \nworking individually on a section of the report which he had researched and then presented to the head \nof the marketing team.  \n \n \nCOMMENT  \n \nSKILLS:  \n \nTeamwork  \nLaboratory work at University involves working in a group of 5/6 people each week, in which it is \nimportant everyone carries out their role successfully to get a good grade as a unit. Worked \nsuccessfully in a team during my work experience, in v ery different jobs. I was able to adapt to those \nenvironments and show good leadership and initiative when faced with tasks.  \n \nCommunication  \nAs part of my laboratory modules, I participated in a presentation of a poster each week to get a grade \nwhich invol ved concisely yet clearly communicating with others. I also had to communicate with the \nhead of marketing at Sony PlayStation to discuss tasks and provide feedback to the company on my \nresearch. Producing draft environmental policies following the ISO 1400 1 standard during my masters \ndegree has given me insight to how this procedure would occur in a professional setting.  \n \nLeadership  \nWhen completing my Duke of Edinburgh bronze, I had to read OS maps and plot the routes my group \nwould make, so was held respo nsible for the completion of the hike. When working with children in a \nschool environment I always had to think on my feet and use initiative to ensure the safety of others.  \n \nComputing Skills  \nMy degree has meant I have increased my understanding in progra ms such as QGIS, ArcGIS, \nJupyterLab, and R where I have made multiple maps which show the interaction of land and certain \nvariables, e.g., flood risk. I have also significantly developed my skills in how I analyse new information \nto make informed decisions  and learnt to consider data carefully.  \n \nNumerical Skills  \nMy understanding of maths and physics has been extended through taking physical modules on the \nclimate, atmosphere and oceans, and earth’s surface processes, which all require a degree of \nmathemati cal knowledge. Minitab has enabled me to further my understanding on the use of statistical \ntests and realise their importance.  \n \nFor further information please contact Julie Smith  on 01695 5 70 696  or email Julie. smith @johnston -\nvere.co.uk  \n  \n \n ",
