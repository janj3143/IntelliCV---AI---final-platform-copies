I have been responsible for \nreviewing  and improving  the implementation of Remotely Operated Shut-Off Valves (ROSOV s) in line with \nthe HSE Good Pra ctice (HSG244) across a Top Tier COMAH site  to ensure compliance . \n• Oil Reclamation Project  – I was responsible  developing the ‘As -built’ P&ID configuration for an oil \nreclamation process  through a series of plant walk downs and inspections . The ‘As-built’ P&ID  will be  used  to \nconduct  a retrospective HAZOP study  and identify any requirements  for additional  protection  measures  and \nimplement  improvement s actions to ensure risks are  As Low as Reasonably Practicable (ALARP).  \nSeptember 2018 to September 2019  – Project  Technician at Power and Water  \nAlongside stud ying my master’s degree,  I work ed part time as a Laboratory Technician for a company who design \nand manufacture Sono -electrochemical water treatment systems for a range of applications.  I was responsible for \ntesting and analysis of all samples, running bench top reactors, using pilot plant equipment and compiling findings \ninto report s to hand to prospective clients.  These included Agriculture, Aquaculture, Mining and Wastewater \nsamples from several  different countries. Always striving for continuous improvement, as part of the lab team  I was \nconstantly searching for methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of the sampling process.  \n   ROSANNA JANE CHARNOCK    \n \n15 Llwyn -Yr-Eos, \nMorriston,  \nSwansea,  \nSA6 6 AT \nTel: 07599 598677  \ne-mail: rosiecharnock@yahoo.com  \n BEng (Hons), MS c, FSE ng  \nCURRICULUM VITAE  \n \n  \n Page 2 of 2 May 2017 to September 2018 – Trainee Process Engineer at Laing O’Rourke  (part of the LiMA Framework)  \nFollowing a successful summer placement with the LiMA team, I secured the position of trainee Process Engineer \nworking within a design team responsible for design and commissioning of Water and Wastewater Treatment \nWorks (WwTW) in North West  England . I wor ked on various projects with my key responsibilities highlighted below:  \n• Participating in Design Review meetings w ithin an interdisciplinary team.  \n• Performing mechanical pump calculations and specific pump selection within Excel -based tools . \n• Authoring sectio ns of the control philosophy and reviewing for other members of the design team . \n• Reviewing and checking mass balances , various process calculations  and technical documents . \n• On site work gaining practical experience of process plant commissioning . \n \nBy working on a diverse range of projects I have gained invaluable practical experience with all stages of design \nand working on both clean and wastewater projects. Additionally, I have continued to develop my interpersonal and \nteam working  skills to compliment and further my technical knowledge and competence.  \nJune 2016 to July 2016  - Westmill Foods  part of Associated British Foods PLC  \nDuring my summer placement at Westmill Foods I participated  in the establishment of a new production line  within \nthe facility . My main role throughout the placement was process optimization, through documenting  the adjustment \nof multiple  variables, within the production line. In addition to this I was part of the safety team who performed the \nrisk assessments for the new line. I work ed with a b road range of professionals and a close -knit team.  \nJanuary 2011 to February 2011  - Jacobs Engine ering  \nI completed a project that involved the design of a small process system involving solvent extraction. This required \nme to interact with engineers from all other engineering disciplines, which confirmed my understanding that \ninterpersonal and teamwor k skills are key competence areas in the workplace. This project required a high degree \nof problem solving, which I found both challenging and enjoyable. Upon completion, I was required to formally \npresent my work to a group of senior engineering personnel , which confirmed the importance of effective written \nand verbal communication.  \nEducation and Qualifications  \nSeptember 2018 to September 2019: Swansea University, MSc Chemical Engineering – Pass   \n Dissertation/Research Project title: “Aspen Process Design of a 100g/hr Pyrolysis Reactor Rig for Biomass Pyrolysis Reaction”  \nSeptember 2015 to June 2018: University o f Chester, BEng (Hons) Chemical Engineering – 2:1 \nSeptember 2012 to June 2015: Winstanley College: A2 Levels - Mathematics – B, Chemistry – B, Geology – A \nSeptember 2007 to July 2012: Deanery High School (GCSE’s) – 12 A* -B, including Maths, English and Scie nce.  \nOther  Qualifications  \nFunctional Safety Engineer (FSEng) certification in accordance with IEC 61511  \nIChemE Fundamentals of Process Safety  \nIChemE HAZOP Leadership & Managemen t \nIChemE Layer of Protection Analysis (LOPA)  \n \nSkills  \n \nTeamwork  Working as a process safety engineer for  a high hazard installation within a Top Tier \nCOMAH site , sometimes under pressure, requires initiative and flexibility. In addition, \ncompleting improvement p rojects a nd facilitating hazard studies  has helped me to b etter \nunderstand how to achieve an effective team dynamic.  \nCommunication  Having had several opportunities  to present my work to members of the Executive \nCommittee and facilitating meetings for the Senior Management team , my communication \nskills  and confidence  have  improved greatly  which allows me to express my opinions freely.  \nOrganisation  Being a graduate engineer  and completing a training plan alongside my main project work \nhas enabled me to enhance my organisational skills, allowing me to meet deadlines and plan \nmy work timescale effectively.  \nIT I am highly computer literate and have experience using a wide variety of programs including \nMicrosoft Office  (particularly Excel) , Aspen , PHAPro, Bowtie XP, PHAST  and SAP. \n \nOther  \n \nI am a n Associate Member of the IChemE  (AMIChemE) ; this allows me to explore the world of engineering and \nhelps me to continue my professional development, towards my goal of being a Chartered Chemical Engineer \nworking within the industry. I have a clean full UK Driver’s  License and my own vehicle.  \n ",
