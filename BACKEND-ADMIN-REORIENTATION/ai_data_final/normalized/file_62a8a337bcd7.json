I have recently completed my master’s in Mechanical Engineering attaining a first-class grade. I have a positive attitude to work and an ability to maintain high performance under pressure allowing me to work efficiently both individually and as part of a team to achieve targets. I have worked in several fast-paced multidisciplinary projects as both a leader and an effective team worker. I am an enthusiastic engineer willing to create a personalised development path and understand and learn all areas of a business to allow for an adaptable and well-rounded view to make important decisions. My aims are to become a chartered engineer, learn from specialist’s in each business function and develop and acquire a new range of skills making the world a better and safer place.\nRELEVANT ENGINEERING PROJECTS\n4th Year Individual Research Project (Master’s Dissertation), September 2019 – April 2020\nWorked alongside Prof. Nimmo conducting research, designing, and simulating various Integrated Renewable Energy Systems for the Isle of Arran (IoA) to cover the electrical demand with renewable resources.\nHOMER software was used to model several systems which could be compared economically and environmentally by matching the specifications of the system to the island as close as possible.\nAcquired future projections of renewables to determine an ideal implementation date for cost effectiveness.\nDecarbonised the IoA, reduced the need for generators and fed excess energy back to the national grid (SSE).\nDissertation consolidated and presented as a viva to industry professionals in a concise manner for review.\nApplied engineering knowledge gained throughout university to produce a research project improving my problem solving, professionalism and intelligence on the importance of cutting carbon emissions.\n3rd Year Group Design Project (Bachelors Dissertation), January 2019 – June 2019\nWorked on a project set by Atkins to provide consultancy with a group of mechanical engineers to design a sustainable, renewable energy storage system. Our final model involved attaining the excess energy produced by wind turbines, in times of low demand, and using molten salt to store energy at a high temperature.\nWhen the demand was high both the storage system and wind turbines could satisfy the electrical demand.\nUsed HOMER software to model and predict how our system would manage in real-life applications.\nFinance and budget report produced to showcase the cost-effectiveness and payback period of project.\nTasked with writing multiple reports which was presented to various subject-specific professionals.\nSkills gained include professionalism, deeper understanding of renewable energy storage and thermal energy transfer and project management skills to ensure all deadlines where met.\nMake & Break Project, January 2018 – June 2018\nWorked in a multicultural team to build a lightweight structure designed to hold a weight of 18kg.\nUsed Solid works and simulation Xpress to simulate the assembly using the results for manufacturing purposes.\nConducted research on the limitations involved in the software and how these would affect the results.\nManufactured both a safe and risky model to be entered into a competition.\nRecorded the costing report meeting the budget of the project including bill of materials (BOM).\nGained experience in the finite element analysis, improved working in a diverse team allowing for original ideas and developed problem-solving skills when deciding which structures should be manufactured.\nEngineering, You’re Hired, January 2018 – February 2018\nWorked in a multidiscipline team to design an electric aircraft by 2050.\nResearched the energy density of different batteries between now and 2050, investigating the growth rates.\nCommunicated my research findings to the team and contributed into deciding on final decision for the aircraft.\nWorked out the costs of implementing batteries, battery facilities, research, and development costs.\nWorked as a team leader which required increased responsibilities and decision making.\nThis project enhanced my presentation skills, communication skills and project management skills.\nEDUCATION\nThe University of Sheffield, 2016 – 2020\nMEng Mechanical Engineering: Overall Grade – Class 1 – 72%\nYear 1: Grade 2:1 – 66%, Year 2: Grade Class I – 71%, Year 3: Grade Class I – 73% Year 4: Grade Class I – 71.5%.\nAttached a separate higher education report outlining the modules taken during university and the mark per module.\nCarmel College, St. Helens, 2014 – 2016\nA Levels: Mathematics (A), Physics (A), Chemistry (A).\nSt Edmund’s Arrowsmith Catholic Centre for Learning, Liverpool, 2009 – 2014\n10 GCSEs at grades A* - B\nIncluding: Mathematics (A*), Core Science (A), Additional Science (A), English Language (B), French (B).\nWORK EXPERIENCE\nHoltex, Huddersfield, August 2018 – September 2018\nEngineering Summer Internship\nEffectively programmed CNC lathes and mills to produce products for Cumming’s Technology.\nUsed innovation for the manufacture of existing products to reduce the number of parts for mass production.\nWorked in a professional environment putting skills and knowledge gained from university into real life applications for further development.\nCo-Operative, Sheffield, June 2017 – March 2019\nCustomer Team Member\nRole required flexibility and dedication to working as part of a team to deliver quality services.\nResponsibilities included handling cash, checkouts, stock control, cashing tills, effective communication, problem solving, team working and interpersonal skills.\nImproved time management and commitment duties to maintain a first-class grade throughout university.\nThe University of Sheffield, Sheffield, September 2018 – June 2019\nSheffield Mentor\nCompleted training to become a Sheffield Mentor. Sheffield Mentors provide subject-specific peer support and guidance for multiple new University of Sheffield students.\nThe role is voluntary, and training for this position focuses on communication and listening skills.\nHOBBIES & INTERESTS\nI was captain for my university 5 a-side football team which improved my leadership skills and how to effectively communicate and encourage a team.\nI am a big fan of the gym and many outdoor sports including running and cycling. I enjoy improving my fitness and bettering my motivation and time keeping allowing me to effectively plan my days. I have high hopes of completing both a tough mudda and a triathlon in the near future.\nBecame a member of Engineers Without Borders keeping up to date with the global movement through joining community groups to help spread the word of engineering for a better future.\nI was recently a mentor for the iForge, a student led workshop, allowing me to help students design and manufacture anything they wanted bringing innovative ideas to life pursuing my passion for engineering.\nTECHNICAL SKILLS\nHOMER – innovative software able to design and simulate renewable energy mini-grids.\nMATLAB – Study into both data analysis and a numerical study into the vibration of beams.\nCFD – completed multiple modules simulating the flow through various pipe setups. Involved creating a geometry, refining the mesh and setting monitoring points to understand how variables affect the results.\nSolid works – Used to build and simulate structures which can be manufactured using laser cutters.\nLaboratory – Acquired knowledge in numerous areas including; tensile testing and Shimadzu machine.\nIT Software – Proficient understanding of Microsoft Word, Excel and PowerPoint.\nCO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES\nAttained a scholarship to travel to Peru for two-weeks and learn about the culture and economy of the country in the summer of 2018.\niMechE student affiliate\nAcademic Skills Certificate 2016 – 2017, enhancing skills of mind mapping, time management and critical thinking. This allowed me to learn new skills which I can use throughout my degree program.\nReferences available upon request. ",
