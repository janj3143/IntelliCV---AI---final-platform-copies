As \nrequested, I send you (via Jan – this is why I write in English) my feedback/thoughts about this Call. \n \nTo summarize our call, I will split it in 4 parts: \n \n1. Inside-Sales / Estimation Dpt / Team Leader: Iwan (ZH) \n2. Outside-Sales / Sales Dpt / Team Leader: Andrea (TI) \n3. Open Questions \n4. JCI Development \n \n \n1. Inside-Sales / Estimation Dpt / Team Leader: Iwan (ZH) \nWe talk briefly about eventually an open position based in Le Mont-sur-Lausanne. This position is the ‘budy’ of the \nOutside-Sales and his tasks are to finalize the Sales-Process by providing a quotation of the solution purposed by the \nOutside-Sales, validated by the Estimation Department, and then to do the follow-up (order/deliveries). \n \n I’m not interested by this position due to the lack of ‘face-to-face’ contacts with the Prospects. \n \n \n2. Outside-Sales / Sales Dpt / Team Leader: Andrea (TI) \nThe open position to replace your actual colleague – leaving at the end of February – was originally to cover the whole \n“Valais/Wallis”. Following internal discussion, you found a solution with a native Swiss-German colleague (knowing \nthe Hochwalliser Deutch ) to cover the German area, which is a better solution to keep and develop this area than to \nuse a native French speaking employee. I agree with you on this topic. \n \nTherefor you suggested me to cover the French area of the “Valais/Wallis” and additionally to take care too of the \narea between Sion-Lausanne-Yverdon and, if needed, to replace the colleague in charge of the Geneva Area. \nThis position as Outside-Sales is to lead Projects by End-Users (i.e. Municipalities, SMB Companies, Industrial \nCompanies, Private Schools, Rental Buildings, etc.) with a greater priority in fire alarm solutions connected to the 118 \nfirefighters ARC (AEAI/VKF standards) than in video-surveillance or access control (intercoms) installations. \n \nMy time will be spent mainly on the road and by the Prospects in this above French speaking Area and, from time to \ntime, in Le Mont-sur-Lausanne for some internal Meetings, Trainings, Technical Support and Activities with the \nEstimation Dpt. \n \n I’m interested by this position to look for the best suitable solution and to present it in front of the End-User, \nmeaning ‘face-to-face’ discussions and on-site to provide explanations and answers. \n \n  \n\n \n \n \n \n3. Open Questions \nAfter our call, I take some time to think about the job activities of the Outside-Sales and the main questions I have are: \n \n- Internal Trainings held by Johnson Controls to be aware of the AEAI/VKF standards (I already downloaded \ntheir “Norme de protection incendie” 01.01.2015)? \nA revisited version of this standard is in preparation for 2026 (PPI 2026) so I need then to stay up to date. \n \n- How is Johnson Controls aware of the Projects from/by the End-Users? \n- Architects’ Offices communications (for new buildings’ installations or renewal of buildings) \n- Working with external Companies by buying pre-selected Leads to discover potential Prospects \n- Working with existing Customers to inform them about new Standards (Installation to be upgraded) \n- Mainly Cold-Visits / Cold-Calls (not necessary the best ROI solution) \n \n \n4. JCI Development \nI talked above about my feelings und understanding following our Teams’ Call. In this 4th part, I would like to get your \nfeelings about following points: \n \n- How well is this area developed – as per today, long-term or short-term Customers? \n \n- Who are the main Competitors and/or Blockers – which Challenges to increase JCI’s \nSuccess in this Area? \n \n- Cross-Selling / Up-Selling thanks other JCI’s Departments or from other JCI’s Locations \nfor Customers with different Subsidiaries throughout Switzerland? \n \n- Actually, in this Area, which is the average % from Projects turned into Sales? \n \n- Actual Customers are requesting new Products/Solutions (i.e. more integrated AI), or \nis the actual Portfolio enough in regards of other Competitors? Which development? \n \n- Do you have local ‘Success Cases’ / ‘Case Studies’ to promote JCI by local Prospects? \n \n- Is there a virtual technology (like 3D) solution which can be used by the Outside Sales \nto make the Prospect experience ‘live’ the Products/Solutions to make him really com- \nfortable (understands how it works or how we can help him to integrate our Solutions \nwith their existing installation (smooth upgrade to 100% JCI installation in the future)? \n \n \nMy goal, as an Outside Sales, is to manage my weeks by visiting Customers and Prospect (valuable activities, instead \nto stay behind a computer at Home or at the Office) with the internal help of the local Team, based either in Le Mont-\nsur-Lausanne or with the colleague based in Brig, and to grow together with brainstorming or other activities to offer \nthe best environment/experience to the Customers and Prospects. \nAn open management environment, where we can discuss openly about everything, granting my independent activi-\nties which - of course - will be reported to my Team Leader: this is what I’m looking for by JCI. \n \nI hope that you too enjoyed our discussion last Friday and I will be happy to read some news from your side about \nthese few points, to better understand in which direction JCI is willing to go and with which kind of resources/tools. \n \n \nWith Kind Regards, \n \n benjamin mora \n ",
