A methodical and efficient approach was taken to accomplish all tasks within the strict timeline thus demanding outstanding project management throughout. Extensive problem solving was necessary to overcome computational errors and effectively optimise the model as well as adapting to unforeseen circumstances that arose. A culmination of all specialist knowledge of the subject was transcribed into a well communicated, meticulous scientific report.\nProfessional collaboration within the engineering department required effective communication for the completion of multiple group assignments; moreover, holding an influential role, remaining diplomatic and motivating team members at times of stress.\nIncreased skill level in engineering computational software performing multiple designs, simulations and analyses in a systematic format. Having no prior knowledge of each programme, great resilience was needed to successfully develop the skills to complete pre-set tasks and draft a professional research-style paper, presenting and discussing results obtained.\nTime spent at CATCH training facility led by Reynolds Training Services whereby Hazard and Operability studies were performed on site to appreciate the necessity for rigorous process safety. A what-if analysis was used when executing risk assessments in small focus groups, followed by a presentation of findings.\nNumerous laboratory classes provided visual applications of fundamental theoretical topics, while augmenting lab etiquette and procedures. Subsequently, report writing significantly enhanced analytical and written communication skills.\nAside from studying, time was spent participating in sport teams and societies. Mainly, representing the university in rugby union and as a member of the engineering society, entering the Frank Morton sports day event.\nSept 2014 – Jul 2016 \t\t\t\tA-Levels\t\t\t    Liverpool Life Sciences UTC\nChemistry\nMaths\nPhysics\nSept 2009 – Jul 2014 \t\t\t\t GCSEs\t\t   Christ The King Catholic High School\nNine GCSEs at grade A – C including English and Maths.\nSkills\nAdaptable\nDisciplined\nIndustrious\nInnovator\nMethodical\nProject management\nResilient\nTeamwork\nTechnical writing\nSoftware\nMicrosoft Office\nMicrosoft Visio\nMATLAB\nSimulink\nApp Designer\nANSYS Fluent\nAspen HYSYS\nCOMSOL Multiphysics\nWork Experience\n2014 – 2017; Jun 2020 – Present        Trainee uPVC Installation Specialist          M J McKettrick Joinery Services\nSupporting family business through hardships during global pandemic.\nWorking efficiently to complete domestic projects within time constraints.\nAssisting with installations, lifting framework safely, maintaining tools and active work area.\nLiaising with customers to ensure they were satisfied with work completed in line with contract agreed.\nFeb 2019 – Nov 2019\t\t\t\t   Waiter\t\t\t\t    Piccolo Italian Bistro\nGreeting and serving customers in a courteous manner.\nWorking efficiently and accurately while in a busy environment.\nRegular use of tills and handling of money.\nAttaining a good knowledge of evening menu including bi-weekly new specials.\nJun 2019 – Aug 2019\t\t\t   Manufacturing Operator\t\t\t            NSG Pilkington\nConfident with glass handling throughout the plant.\nOperating on WS2 (windscreen), SL2 (sidelight) and ST1 (sidelight toughening) furnaces, knowledge of different procedures as per active job essential to establish correctly shaped and toughened glass.\nLamination of windscreens and backlights using “vacuum ring” and “vacuum bag” techniques for pre-nip cycle stage. Working knowledge of operating pressurised autoclave used for lamination.\nEdge stress meter and Reflective sharples equipment used extensively to calculate stress of post-production sample glass.\nIn-depth temperature analysis of WS2 furnace using Datapaq software and presenting graphical results.\nFinished product packaged safely and securely for international shipping.\nRegularly completing tasks on time or before deadlines.\nJun – Sept 2017 & 2018\t\t          Marine Lake Cruises Helmsman\t\t\t Southport Watersports\nHelmsman of a passenger ferry while narrating a speech describing the lake and surrounding area.\nQuickly adapting to a situation when young or elderly customers needed assistance boarding or alighting from the vessel.\nA calm attitude towards potentially difficult customers.\nPlaced in charge of exchanging money from the public.\nHobbies, Voluntary Work and Achievements\nI am an avid dinghy sailor at my local club, Southport Sailing Club, while also a prominent member of the management committee as Sailing Secretary. My roles include liaising with other clubs/associations to organise events and generating the club racing calendar for the forthcoming year. This role requires exceptional organisational skills to prepare many months in advance and incorporating the opinions of other sailors to continually improve the standard of racing.\nAs well as this, I utilise my dinghy instructor qualification to volunteer my time during school holidays teaching young people how to sail following the RYA code. Implementing health and safety is always a top priority, ensuring all sailors are prepared appropriately for the weather conditions. Maintaining dinghies and powerboats is also essential for extending the lifetime of equipment, whilst gaining a working knowledge of 4-stroke engines from this activity. In addition to sailing, I am also an accomplished skier and snowboarder having skied in many resorts across the Alpes.\nFull clean Driving Licence.\nAssociate member of Institute of Chemical Engineers and Energy Institute.\nIOSH approved Principles of Process Safety Management certificate (April 2020).\nRYA Sailing Dinghy Instructor with Racing Instructor Endorsement (August 2015 – revalidated 2020).\nLevel 2 National Powerboat Certificate (August 2014).\nRYA First Aid certificate (June 2019)\nBronze Duke of Edinburgh award (July 2014).\nReferees\nDr Abbas Hasan\nSchool of Chemical Engineering\nUniversity of Hull\nA.Hasan@hull.ac.uk\nMr Andrew Bleakley\nManufacturing Coordinator\nNSG Pilkington\nAndrew.bleakley@nsg.com ",
