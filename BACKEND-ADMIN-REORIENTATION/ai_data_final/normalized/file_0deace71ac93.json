Acceptance of this brief \nimplies acceptance of these terms  \n \nABOUT THE COMPANY  \n \nOxford Immunotec  is a global, commercial -stage diagnostics company that provides innovative tests \nin the field of infectious disease and immunology. We are pionee rs in measuring the T cell part of the \nhuman immune system. Oxford Immunotec is part of the PerkinElmer group of companies.   \n \nOxford Immunotec’s  primary test is the T -SPOT®.TB test, a class -leading test for detecting latent \ntuberculosis. Tuberculosis is the leading cause of infectious disease death globally, and a top ten killer \nfor humankind. 10 million people develop Active TB disease a year, of which approximately 1.6 millio n \nwill die, including 250,000 children.  \n \nAs we lack an effective vaccine against TB, our ability to control and eventually eradicate TB replies on \nscreening for carriers of TB (so -called Latent Tuberculosis Infection – LTBI) followed by administration \nof preventative antibiotic treatment to those infected.  \n \nLTBI screening is already a cornerstone of TB control in the developed world, and there is increasing \nglobal public health mobilization to bring the benefits of TB screening and preventative treatment to less \ndeveloped countries. For example, the UN has declared its intent to get another 30 million people onto \npreventative treatment by 2022.  \n \nThe T -SPOT. TB test is a relatively new blood test for detecting TB infection, designed to replace the \nantiquate d Tuberculin Skin Test (TST) that has hitherto been used for this purpose. The advantages of \nT-SPOT. TB are numerous, including greater accuracy, quicker turnaround and a strong health \neconomic case. The T -SPOT. TB test has regulatory approval in over 50 cou ntries worldwide (including \nthe US, Europe, China and Japan), is supported by over 500 peer -reviewed scientific publications and \nis recommended in guidelines in over 40 countries. The T -SPOT. TB test is named as one of the 100 or \nso Essential Diagnostics by  the WHO to which every country in the world should have access. Over 20 \nmillion T -SPOT. TB tests have been sold globally and somebody in the world receives a T -SPOT. TB \ntest about every 8 seconds.  \n \nThis test has a global market opportunity greater than $1 billion in revenue per year. Despite the \nsuccess of the company to date, the prospects for continued growth of T -SPOT. TB are stronger than \never. This is driven by both external and internal factors. Externally, the outlook for market growth is \nrobust both as guidelines increasingly favour blood testing over the TST and due to the expansion of \nthe market as more TB screening programs are established worldwide. Internally, the company is rolling \nout a major new product innovation cycle to expand the clinical utility and improve workflow of the T -\nSPOT®.TB test both of which will further improve uptake.  \n \nIn developing the T -SPOT. TB test, the company has generated world -leading expertise in the functional \nmeasurement of the T cell part of the immune system.  \n \nThe company is playing a leading role in the COVID19 pandemic. We have been chosen by the UK \ngovernment to support the approval  and deployment of COVID19 vaccines, by providing critical \ninformation on how and whether the vaccines produce an effective immune response. Additionally, the \nCompany has recently launched its T -SPOT. COVID  test; a test to measure T cell immunity to SARS -\nCoV-2. This test has wide application and is being made available around the world.  \n \nOur Vision is to significantly grow the Company through both organic new product development (via \nR&D) and inorganically through acquisition. PerkinElmer is keen to support us in this Vision through \nsupporting the acquisition of additional companies in the immunology and infectious disease space, \nusing Oxford Immunotec as a foundation around which to build.  \n \n \n3 The company has a strong global footprint with its main headquarter s in Abingdon, United Kingdom, \nregional headquarters in Marlborough, Massachusetts and Singapore, and country offices  in Shanghai, \nChina, Yoko hama, Japan; and Seoul, South Korea.  \n \nOxford Immunotec  has achieved significant revenue growth historically and revenues are expected to \nexceed $80m in 2021 . The company is in a great financial position, with strong revenue growth, high  \ngross margins,  and strong financial backing .  \n \nSince the company was founded in 2002, Oxford Immunotec has created a highly unique and \ncollaborative culture for its employees  built on solid values that reflect an exceptional company. \nThe company is led by a highly skilled and experienced, thoughtful and approachable management \nteam.
