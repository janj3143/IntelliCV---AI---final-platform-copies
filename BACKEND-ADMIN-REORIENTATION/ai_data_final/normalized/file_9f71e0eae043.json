Started as a project assistant during my industrial placement into my cur rent role as a \nProject Engineer/Manager.   \n \nFully Automated Creams Production Line (£4.4M)  \nA programme of projects which included decommissioning of 2 production lines, re -location of an existing production line, installation of a \nnew ISO grade 8 clean room, HVAC installation, component Rationalisation and finally the  design, install  and validation of a Fully Automated \nCreams Packaging Production Line.  \n \n• Fully Automated Creams Production Line (200 T.p.m)  \nManaged the project through the complete life -cycle incl uding feasibility, supplier selection, detailed design, installation, validation \nand handover/close out. excellent internal and external stakeholder management to ensure the project was delivered to scope, budget \nand schedule. Detailed project handover wit h very positive end user feedback. Production Line consisted of tube box loader, robotic \ntube loader, dual headed filling machine, cartoner, SRP/Shrink -wrap, Case packer and automated palletizer.  Coordinated equipment \ninstallation and commissioning with eq uipment supplier to ensure end user satisfaction. Worked with two international suppliers \nsimultaneously to complete the full production line (Germany and Sweden). Management of a 15 -man project team including trips \nto Germany and Sweden for Factory Accept ance Testing.   \n \n• Production Line Decommission  \nDecommission and disposal of 2 liquid filling/packaging lines which had come to their end of service. All products integrated  onto \nother existing production lines. Validation protocols produced and completed for all products/components. Feasibility study \ncompleted to ensure capacity of existing lines not reached. Increase of product output of 18% on new lines.   \n \n• Relocation of Production Line  \nLiquid filling/packaging line relocated to ensure sufficient space available when installing new fully automated lin e. Full production \nline re -validated when re -location was complete.  \n \n• ISO 8 Clean Room Installation  \nClean room installation which included structural work, product contact equipment washroom, automated rapid rise door install s, \ncompletely new HVAC system r ated to ISO 8, new resin flooring and new suspended ceiling with LED lighting (60% energy \nreduction). Management of multiple contractors simultaneously.  \n \n• Component Rationali sation  \nExtensive component Rationalisation project which reduced tube diameters fr om 11 to 4 and carton cross sections from 13 to 4. All \nnew components validated. Direct cost saving on format change parts of £360,000. Indirect cost saving from breakdown and form at \nchange over reduction of £28,000 p/a.  \n \nRotary Labelling System ( £600k)  \nAssisted the project manager during my industrial placement on a dual headed rotary labeling machine for a liquid filling prod uction line. \nDuties included preparing validation documents, carrying out validation testing, holding supplier meetings and attendi ng the supplier factory \nacceptance testing. Labeler replacement removed the bottle -neck of the packaging process leading to an increase of 22% in product output.  \n \nIndependent Carton Coding Machine (150k)  \nFirst independent project during industrial placeme nt. Managed a small team of 4 people throughout the project lifecycle. Carton coding \nmachine which used thermal transfer technology. camera verification system built into the machine to detect poor print, missi ng print and data \nmatrix verification. £12,000  p.a cost saving due to 50% reduction in man hours.  \n \n \nUniversity of Huddersfield – Mechanical Design & Project Management Processes  \nProject Management Processes  \nFinal year dissertation project during my time at the University of Huddersfield. Title of thesis ‘Applying the Theory of Mod ern Project \nManagement Approaches for Overall Process Improvement of a small/medium enterprise’. Literature review of PRINCE2, APM and ISPE \nproject management guides. Implemented a new structure to the businesses project management model including the introduction of project \nlife cycle, stage gate process and standard templates.  \nMechanical Design (Car Trailer)  \nCompletely re -designed a car trailer to a specification. Solidworks was used to create a model which including FEA analysis to ensure the \nstructure could withstand the load of a small car. Each part of the trailer was designed and analyzed as an individual  part before being \nassembled using Solidworks 3D CAD/CAM software.   \n \n ",
