In addition to knowledge of chemical engineering theory, my degree has also allowed me to develop my teamworking skills, through working on many group projects.\nDuring my studies I have been able to gain significant industrial experience through summer placements at CF Fertilisers UK. These placements have given me experience of working on a large, upper tier COMAH, chemical manufacturing site, on several different production plants.\nThrough my industrial experience I developed my practical technical skills as I carried out plant investigations and design work. I was able to enhance my teamworking and interpersonal skills, working alongside engineers from different disciplines, plant operators and delivering presentations to senior management.\nThroughout my Masters year I gained research experience, working with Autichem, a specialist in the development of continuous flow reactors, to develop and improve the effectiveness of an advanced reactor.\nQualifications\nMasters Degree : University of Chester (2015-2019)\nMEng (Hons) Chemical Engineering 2nd Class where I averaged a 2:1 in the MEng year.\nMy Masters modules included: A Research Project, Project Management, Process Modelling & Simulation, Nuclear Technology, Pharmaceuticals and Food Technology.\nA Levels: Tarporley Sixth Form College\nMathematics (B), Chemistry (B), Physics (D)\nAS Level: Biology (C)\nGCSE: Tarporley Community High School\nChemistry (A*), Biology (A*), Physics (A), Maths (A), English Literature (B), English Language (B), Geography (B), History (B), Business Studies (B), ICT (Merit), French (B)\nIndustrial Experience\n2018-2019 Autichem, Thornton Research Park, Chester\nI conducted a research project utilising microalgae to absorb CO2 in a prototype reactor, which included\nPerforming a range of experiments on the reactor.\nInterpreting the experimental data to identify the ideal conditions, such as residence time and flowrates, to maximise the performance of the microalgae within the reactor.\nMaking recommendations for improvements which will be implemented into the design of the reactor.\nSummer 2017 : CF Fertilisers UK, Ince, Chester\nI developed the process design for a new steam desuperheater station, which involved:\nProducing a process specification following review of plant data\nWorking with an equipment supplier to select the optimum equipment design.\nDesigning control system, selection of installation location, developing P&ID, participation in HAZOP study, production of project scope and initiation of Management of Change document.\nThe design I proposed was successfully installed in a plant outage in 2018.\nSummer 2016 : CF Fertilisers UK, Ince, Chester\nI lead an investigation into intermittent periods of excessively high temperature in the low-pressure steam supply to the ammonium nitrate (AN) plant, which risked initiating decomposition of the product. This involved:\nIdentifying all supplies into the site low pressure steam supply\nCorrelating the periods of high temperatures in the steam supply to the AN plant with the operation of different plants across the site.\nIdentifying potential sources of high temperature steam and using plant measurements and heat and mass balances to confirm those which were responsible for the high temperatures seen in the LP steam supply.\nI then investigated alternative options to prevent the excessive temperatures.\nI also carried out post installation checks on plant changes and marked up P&IDs\nSummer 2015 : GrowHow UK (now CF Fertilisers UK), Ince, Chester\nI carried out performance trials on a large gas fired 35 bar steam generator to assess the efficiency and capacity compared with original design.\nThe trials identified that the boiler maximum output was reduced from design, due to faults in the control of the burners which were restricting the firing.\nFollowing correction of the identified faults, the maximum steam output was increased by over 150 tonnes/day, resulting in significant reductions in plant start-up costs.\nI performed trials on the compound fertiliser plant, calculating the granulation efficiency of the plant based on sampling and analysis of the size distribution of the particles through the process.\n6th Form work experience placement : GrowHow UK (now CF Fertilisers UK), Ince, Chester\nI assisted with development of screens and documentation for the ammonia plant DCS control system.\nSkill Set\nPersonal\nI have completed the Duke of Edinburgh Gold expedition and also received the Chief Scout Gold Award.\nI enjoy sports, in particular football which I play regularly as well as going to the gym. I also enjoy travelling and spent the summer of 2019 traveling around Europe.\nReferees ",
