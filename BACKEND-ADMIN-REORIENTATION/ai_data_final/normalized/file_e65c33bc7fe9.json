The role of OT Cyber Security Consultant is now a need in Infrastructure based Industrial Control Systems with the convergence of IT-OT systems. The projects encountered are of front-end advancements in the use of the Internet of Things solutions for the Asset Management domain. He has exercised the mapping of security requirements to Industry led Security Frameworks such as the NIST Cyber Security Framework. He is also Cyber Security CRE (Contractors Responsible Engineer) for the East Coast Mainline project and a key personnel/SME in the details of technologies for the Electrification infrastructure applications.\nJuly 2018 to Nov 2021 Siemens Rail Electrification\nPosition: Digital Substation Design Manager (Acting)/Senior Design Engineer / Product and Solutions Security Officer (PSSO) / Digital Sales Rep for UK Electrification Business\nHe was part of one of the most unique set of Protection and Control Engineering teams within the Rail Electrification industry with expertise across the value chain. His role within the business was to provide expertise around Digital Substation communications (IEC 61850), innovations and security solutions being deployed into Electrifications digital space including the ever-growing IoT solutions deployment into the Electrification industry both at the edge (IoT Gateway) and platform level (Mindsphere in this case). As PSSO his responsibility was to ensure security is embedded into each of the Project Development Lifecycle stages from Planning, Design, Implementation through to Acceptance. He was also a go to personnel for performing and/or managing queries relating to both Data Communications and Cyber Security with the various stakeholders of the rail projects encountered.\nAug 2015 to Jun 2018 DNVGL\nPosition: Smart Energy Consultant\nHe was part of the leaders in Testing, Inspection and Certification organisations globally. He was immersed in leading technological advances in the whole arena of Smart Grid/Energy from the internationally recognised IEC61850 standard to the depths of the Smarter Infrastructures (Generation, Energy Storage, Water, Rail Electrification) outside the modern-day substation. His role in DNVGL has allowed him to conduct Edition 1 and 2 IEC61850 testing on vendor client and server products globally and provided advisory services along the way. He had also become an IEC61850 advisor for system engineers of the Rail Electrification movements here in the UK railway substations.\nSept 2011 to Aug 2015 ALSTOM Grid UK\nAug 2014 to Aug 2015\nPosition: IEC61850 Technical Lead\nHe managed the running of the Communication Protocol Test Section of Automation Product Laboratories. He was also in a position where he was a point of contact/reviewer globally for IEC61850 queries providing support to all R&D, Applications and Marketing teams across different countries. He has successfully completed the thorough UCAIug (Utility Communication Architecture International Users Group) Accreditation such that the laboratory can test and certify IEC61850 Edition 1 products, but now test and certify to the latest Edition 2 of the IEC61850 standard.\nHe had also stepped into a Project Manager role in some projects where IEC61850 is being deployed to help drive the project through IEC61850 device and configuration tool development. He had conducted the recruitment process for the team’s growth. He has provided training to teams in the UK, India and China. He has helped in providing direction to the personnel driving the Cyber Security testing requirements.\nHe was selected to lead a Core Team for Alstom Grid’s participation in the biannual UCA Interoperability event. This is a large scale, highly technical, gathering of all product vendors involved in IEC61850.\nOne of his best achievements of my professional career to date is the awarding of the Global Employee Recognition Award for the SAS sector of Alstom Grid for the year 2013-2014.\nSept 2011 to Apr 2014\nPosition: IED Communications Protocol Test Engineer\nAs part of the Substation Automation Solutions (SAS) sector within Alstom Grid, he worked with and tested Protection Relays/IEDs which have IEC61850 Communication Protocol capabilities for the Smarter Grid Substations including other emerging infrastructures like Rail. He tested and certified devices resulting in a Certificate of Conformance according to the IEC61850 Server Test Procedures as defined by the UCAIug using KEMA tools. He was also an active ‘participating’ member of the UCAIug IEC61850 Testing Committee and have helped to improve the International Test Procedures.\nDec 2006 to Aug 2011 Central Networks/WPD\nPosition: Control Systems Support Engineer\nHis role in the Control Systems Support Team, which was a part of the Network Operations business, involved using analytical approaches to problem solving on GE’s Real-Time System ‘Power on Fusion’(POF), formerly known as ENMAC. My customers on a daily basis were front end users like Control Engineers and Data Teams. He also supported Automation Field Engineers when having to interrogate problems involving RTU Configurations, the Network Diagram and SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) Communication using protocols like DNP3, Mk2A, Westinghouse WISP+ and Mk3. He became the point of contact across Central Networks/WPD for any investigation into Protocol Communications acquired into the system either by GPRS, X25 Vodafone Paknet and private SCADA networks.\nHis main responsibility was the deployment and remote support of RTU’s on the master end Control System. He became the key point of contact for the Automation Field Engineers for any remote and master end problems encountered.\nAs well as the Secondary Distribution Network, he supported a different dedicated task force of engineers deploying and updating RTU’s on the Primary Network 132/66/33kV.\nHe had also been involved in major projects such as the transition from a legacy Control System to the current POF Control System. Another project was an RTU Replacement Project where he was supporting field engineers commissioning new SAT RTU’s at Primary sites replacing older D20 RTUs. He was selected to look into the new possible RTUs like Schneider and ABB (RTU560) RTUs and their Configurator Tool capabilities, including FAT Testing of the Mk3 Protocol.\nHe has provided training to new colleagues into the team and provided demonstrations to internal and external visitors into the section.\nCOMMENT\nAn ambitious and resourceful professional seeking to provide and further his knowledge in a sector that is itself ambitious. With an in-depth experience in all parts of the end-to-end architectures has created, in him, a person eager to deliver and succeed in anything he embarks upon.\nWorking in a Senior and Principal role both on Remote SCADA Management Systems, Substation Automation Systems, Operational Cyber Security and the emerging Digital Substation IoT industry has provided a sound and broad knowledge base which is eager to develop further into the ever-developing vectors of communication in Critical Infrastructures. With experience as a recognised UK and International trainer, certifier and advisor in SCADA and Substation Automation (IEC 61850), He has a wide appreciation of what is expected from Products and Solutions in Critical Infrastructure.
