XpertRule  software allows clients \na unique insight into their business through its manufacturing intelligence software. Data streams from \noperations are becoming increasingly complicated  and abundant. It is getting more difficult to sor t this out \ninto a digestible and meaningful data set. Manufacturing organisations are under constant pressure to \nbecome more efficient – but with such heavy streams  of data the visibility is increasingly blurred. XpertRule  \nunique tools help create a clear vision for business – bottom to the top – in layers that are open enough to \nenable key decisions to be made whether that is operational efficiency / asset performan ce increasing the \nautomation piece through IIOT. It does not stop there though as it also has the ability to thread into the C \nsuit. \n \nOver  the years it became apparent that the integrations needed to make the software work most effectively  \nwere better suit ed to Channel relationships via Channel Partners.  \n \nChannel partners are often unique with levels of domain  experience well beyond the in house skills in the \nbusiness. They need to be identified / nurtured and often led through the first few sales cycles.  \n \nWorking closely with organisations such as Siemens who have opened  the Mindsphere partner relationships \nand are openly encouraging XpertRule to engage with them has accelerated the potential growth of licence \nsales.  \n \nThis expansion leads us to the recruitm ent of additional resource – to capitalise on thew opportunities in \nhand and build  out those that are being developed by the new channel partners and also by developing direct \nsales with large manufacturing organisations.  \n \nThis role thus is a mix of Channe l relationships and new business sales – quite a complicated match up to \nsource.  \n \nCandidates at this level are difficult to find – you need to understand the culture of the business and its \nplayers and work round this to find someone who fits in.  \n \nXpertRul e is a small company – pitching well above it weight and in competition with many larger \norganisations who have the benefit of significant resource.  \n \nTo finds this candidate we must  match and, in some cases,  better the offer that they themselves have to \nkeep their own staff.  \n \nClearly,  we want a winner and they are similarly well protected and well rewarded in their companies and are \noften uncomfortable  joining a guerrilla organisation such as XpertRule  – so they have to be enticed and see \nthe vision. This m eans all parties in the business selling the vision and at the same time interviewing.  \n \n \n \nWe have to also offer competitive  packages.  \n \nRECRUITMENT PROPOSAL  www.johnston -vere.co.uk     |   2  Base to reflect the skills – 75-90K (It is a widespread  but for instance a top-level Siemens account manager \nwith Mindsphere is on at least 80+ in some instances 100K)  \nCommission - (these are always a bone of contention and every effort should be to incentivise  - short medium \nand long term) \nCar allowance  (Whilst this is not a given - often it’s a cash sum added to the base - nobody wants the hassle \nof leases)  \nPHI (this is often a standard)  & Death in Service  \nSome Pension enhancement  \nShare incentive Schemes are common - but I would advise that this is not something they need to know at \nthis stage - it has no or little relevance  \n \n \n \nThe objective is to make a sweet enough offer to a candidate to also make it difficult for them to leave  \nForward promises to salespeople  sadly are meaningless – (they are to leadership people) – a salesperson 's \nfocus should be on maximising opportunities – nothing else should get in the way.  \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \nRECRUITMENT PROPOSAL  www.johnston -vere.co.uk     |   3  FEE STRUCTURE  \n \n \nOur typical fees for this search would be 25%, This enables to maintain our long-standing  relationship and \nremain competitive.  \n \nThe costs applicable are broken down into three stages, as follows:  \n \nJob Title  Business Development Exec / Manager  \nStage  one Retainer  5000  \nStage  two Shortlist   \nStage  three  Placement  25%-stage 1&2  \nTotal  25% base salary  \nAll charges are subject to Value Added Tax at the current rate where applicable.  \n \n \nExpenses  \n \nThe costs applicable in respect of the Retainer are in relation to the Client’s initial instructions to and/or \nappointment of the Company and all preparatory work undertaken whether  on after or before the signing of \nthis agreement .
