The product ranges primarily were sold via channel partners. We dealt directly with strategic accounts in the diagnostic industry. Motivation of channel account managers, to focus on our portfolios, was key to success and required a high ability to provide them with sales and technical support. Training them in the field was also a requirement. In conjunction, with senior corporate marcom, I developed a project to raise awareness of our products for the stem cell market. Once approval was granted I was appointed project lead which involved market research, developing networks with key influencers and commercial teams to deliver our value proposition. This resulted in a much greater interaction/acceptance level with this customer group at a regional level. To increase our consultative approach I was asked to become a trainer of our counsellor sales program which was rolled out across our EU teams. This lead to me being asked to join our focus account management team to deliver a cross divisional approach to one of our key pharmaceutical accounts.
