Technical Pre-Sales requires a level of business acumen that has allowed him to not only look at the technical capabilities and how products will benefit the customer but also the financial benefits in terms of ROI.\nPre-Sales is about understanding the customer, their requirements and having the ability to influence the customer in such a way that they are guided down the road of your product. Should a PoC then be required, half the work should already have been done in winning given the success criteria would have been written by the influencing SE.\nVendor / Technology Consolidation:\nThe market has seen a paradigm shift in the last few years where, through acquisition, vendors are able to offer many more security capabilities under one banner. This has resulted in the Pre-Sales role now having to develop into one that involves both technical ability and the capability to have a CFO level conversation around consolidation cost benefit.\nCloud Migration:\nCustomers across midmarket, SME and large Enterprise are realising the benefits that moving to the cloud can potentially bring.  For many customers this can present a daunting and unchartered territory preventing them from moving forward.  SE’s have a requirement to be articulate allowing them to have that migration conversation with customers. Being able to present that journey from on-prem to cloud in a way that removes any concerns for a customer is paramount in a world where cloud compute is prominent.\nChannel Enablement\nIn his previous two roles, he has excelled at enabling partners from what was described as a “frozen territory”.  Partners were chosen on their technical ability and their ability to work as an SI and capability around solid and reliable delivery skills to customers. His role was to ensure that the partners were in a position to be able to have that technical conversation with customers to a high degree. Update sessions were held regularly to ensure that all partner information was up to date. In the year following partner upskilling, seven figure targets were achieved.\nHobbies / Spare time\nCardiac First Responder for Sandpiper Wildcat Out-Of-Hospital Cardiac Arrests\nRegular fundraising for local charities through annual cycle sportive events\nMountain biking and road cycling\nHill walking\nFor further information please contact David Beeston on 01695 570 696 or email davidb@johnston-vere.co.uk ",
