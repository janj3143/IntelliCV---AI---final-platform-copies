A key component of my role is a multi-function analysis of potential and existing projects with recommendations reported to Senior Management and the respective Project Managers to ensure strategic fit, and with the intention for opportunities to be maximised and threats mitigated for seamless execution.\nMy exposure and experience during my career are broad and includes energy mega-projects to smaller batch chemicals scopes including food grade and API products where additional controls are required to be implemented.\nI have a proactive and driven character and my questioning nature has led me to implement numerous improvements in each of the companies where I have been employed. My solutions have helped the projects with more efficient use of resources, improved customer satisfaction, time saving, and consistency and accuracy in reporting.\nAlthough driven I have an easy-going character where no problem is impossible to solve. My character traits have obtained me respect and trust from my Clients, senior management, peers and others in my workspace, many of whom I am still close friends.\nIn addition, I have been used as an interim manager on a number of occasions to turn around troubled projects and I mentor trainee project managers / engineers.\nThe role you are advertising is an ideal and interesting fit. I know my experience and character would be beneficial to Air Products growth as a company.\nI look forward to hearing back from you.\nYours sincerely,\nJerome Ganachaud ",
