June2010  \n In May 2009 we acquired the assets and intellectual property of California -based Accsense, Inc ., a \ncompany that designs remote monitoring systems using self healing wireless mesh network \ntechnology. The acquisition of Accsense Inc.’s remote monitoring technology, desi gns and hardware \nhas bolstered our successful data acquisition product portfolio. To date we have continued to sell \nthe Accsence products solely in the USA, through our  existing  DAQ Distributor. Manufacturing of the \nAccsense range has been transferred to our ISO9001 -certified facility near Cambridge.  \n \nOur plan  for 2010/11  is to introduce the Accsense range into Europe and the rest of the world to \nrespond to the increasing demand for wireless sensor solutions that are quick to deploy, easy -to-use \nand requir e no software installation or complex configuration.  This product has great potential and \ncomplements our existing data acquisition range and will provide us with an opportunity to target \nnew vertical market applications.    \n \nThe Accsense self healing wir eless mesh network solution measures a wide range of physical \nproperties - almost anything that can be measured such as temperature, humidity, light, noise, \nvibration, wind speed, pH, pressure, flow, soil moisture, tank levels, gas concentration – and make s \nthe real -time measurements available online via the world wide web.  Accsense’s cost -effective, out -\nof-the-box solution has been successfully used in food processing plants, medical manufacturing \nfacilities, laboratories, agricultural establishments, hos pitals and across a number of industrial \napplications.  \n \nThe existing Grant data acquisition product range extends from high specification, portable data \nlogging systems (Squirrel family) through to fully integrated custom -configurable acquisition and \ncont rol systems (dataTaker family), while Eltek, the Cambridge -based Grant affiliate, produces \nSquirrel variants primarily for remote logging.     \n \nLocation of role and  Travel requirements : \nThe person appointed will be based at our site just south of Cambridge  and must therefore live \nwithin reasonable daily travelling distance.  The new  product  roll-out is expected to require at least  \n50%  of the job holder’s time  for the first 12  to 18  months , requiring a considerable amount of \noverseas travel.  Thereafter we an ticipate between 50 and 85 days travel per annum.  \n \nFinancial goals:  \n \nThe main responsibility is to set up a new international (outside USA) distribution network for the \nnew product range, and to hence to drive the sales revenue at an approved gross margin level,  \neffectively from zero to a figure to be determined and grow the business.  First year sales revenues \nwill be targeted at between £250,000 and £350,000.  \n \nIn addition to this we also expect contribution to the continued growth of sales for the S quirrel \nproduct lines as a result of more activity and sales support for the well establish existing \ninternational dealers.  \n \nFurther details about expected achievement levels would be discussed  with candidates  at interview \nstage.  \n \n \n \n \n \nStrictly Confidential.
