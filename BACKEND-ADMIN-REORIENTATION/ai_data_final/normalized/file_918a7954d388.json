I am always looking to learn new skills and expand my experiences in the workplace \nto become a more effective team member, while  actively pursuing  my own professional development \ntoward s Chartered Engineer status with the IMechE  as soon as possible . \nEduca tion \n2016 – 2020 : 1st Class MEng (Hons)  Master of  Mechanical Engineering (IMechE  Accredited ) \nLIVERPOOL JOHN MOORES UNIVERSITY  \n• 1st year average: 92%  \n• 2nd year average: 86% : Engineering Mathematics, Materials and Manufacturing Process es, \nApplied Mechanics, Engineering Practice, Thermodynamics and Fluid Mechanics, Mechanical \nDesign, and Mechatronics.  \n• 3rd year average: 88% : Engineering Analysis, Vehicle Dynamics, Industrial Management, \nMechanical Design, and Thermodynamics . \no Engineering Project: Deve lopment of stabilization augmentation system for the Puma \nHelicopter (Awarded the Institution Project Award by IMechE ). \n• 4th year average: 81%: Conventional and Alternative Energy Systems, Computational Fluid \nDynamics, Additive Manufacturing Processes, Operations Research, and Group Project (Steam \nCooking Integration).  \nSeptember 2013 - July 2016 : A-level, PENKETH  SIXTH FORM COLLEGE  \nMath ematics  B \nChemistry  B \nPhysics  C \n \nSeptember  2008 - July 2013 : GCSE, PENKETH HIGH SCHOOL  \n13 GSCEs attained including English Language, English Literature, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, \nPhysics,  and ICT.  \nSkills  \nTechnical Skills \nI have developed strong skills utilizing  software such as Solidworks  to design and build mechanical \ncompone nts such as battery housings and components for additive manufacturing .  \nI also have a good understan ding of ANSYS F luent  and Solidworks flow simulat ion and how they can \nbe u sed to model different  fluid flow conditions in both convention al mechanical systems , in addition \nto more uni que applications  such as blood flow through arteries . \nProblem Solving  \nMy self -lead project was to design and implement a stabilization system for a helicopter . This required  \nme to identify the key requirements of the system an d ensure they could be quantified and were valid \nwithin the timeframe.  I then had to gain a technical understanding of helicopter control systems \nunderstanding how each control path would cause the system to react. The instability of the motion \nduring a co ntrol input could then be resolved using a series of feedback loops along each control \nchannel  using MATLAB . The system was then checked against military rotorcraft requirements to \nensure agile handling qualities to certify that the system met the initial system requirements.   \nTeamwor k \nHaving worked multiple customer service jobs, I am experienced in working as a team to deliver high \nservice standards in both retail and food services. These roles enabled me to develop clear \ncommunication skills and confide nce, dealing with both customers and other members of my team . \nExperience  \nApril 2019 - Present : Store Colleague, GO OUTDOORS  \n• Maintaining store standards  by constantly reviewing the condition of the shopfloor.  \n• Presenting  technical knowledge to custom ers about the products  sold instore . \n• Reorganized  the stock cupboard  by brand and gender  to greatly improve  service efficiency . \n \nJuly 2018 – October 2018: Chill ed Colleague , ASDA STORES LTD  \n• Picking stock from the storeroom and chillers to be taken to the shop floor.  \n• Effectively restocking the shelves on the shopfloor to ensure the shortest dates were sold first . \n• Working with other team members to complete shift t asks efficiently by catering to changing  \npriorities throughout the day.  \n \nJune 2017: Volunteer, GLOBAL VISION INTERNATIONAL NEPAL \n• Rejuvenating various orphanages and schools  by b uilding benches, tables and shelving units for \nmonasteries and schools.  \n• Liaising with locals and organizing events for the children in the community, such as football \nmatches.  \n \nAugust 2015  - February 201 8: Front of House Staff Member,  The Millhouse Pub \n• Providing excellent customer service to customers, in a professional and fr iendly manner.  \n• Taking food and drink orders and keying the information onto the till system correctly.  \n• Maintaining a clean and tidy workspace as well as ensuring the restaurant and bar areas were \nalways clean and presentable.  \n• Actively dealing with complaints to ensure customer satisfaction and resolve the issue immediately.  \nJuly 2013: Work Experience, Office assistant, LJ FINANCIAL PLANNING LIMITED  \n• Input of client data from Excel spreadsheets to Intelligent Office systems.  \nOctober  2013 : Work Experience, Assistant Lab Technician, MEGGIT T AEROSPACE  \n• Working alongside engineers and lab technicians across various departments, gaining an \nunderstanding of how a n engineering  project is spread across multidisciplinary teams to achieve a \nsingular  goal.  \nAchievements and Hobbies  \n• Achieved the IMechE Institution Project Award , obtained for attaining the highest grade in \nmy engineering project.  \n• Self-Taught guitarist of more than 10 years .
