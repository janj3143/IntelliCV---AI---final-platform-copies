As a natural resources process engineer , I am involved wit h projects \nacross a variety of sectors, including: oil and gas, decarbonisation and wastewater.  My role has \nthus far comprised o f: \n \n• Assisting with the concept design of a hydrogen from waste production facility. During this \nproject I produced process engin eering deliverables such as; basis of design, flow diagrams, \nequipment specification s, heat and mass balance  and a storag e/refuelling model.  \n• Workin g on a FEED study to re -route offshore fluids to a different  onshore processing \nfacility . On this project I produced P&ID’s, PFD’s, heat and mass balance , equipment \nspecifications and Aspen HYSYS simulation.  I also remotely scribed HAZOP’s, HAZID’s and \nENVID studies.  \n• Working on a concept study to implement a compressor at a natural gas processing facility. \nDuring this project I produced Aspen HYSYS simulations, P&ID’s, heat and mass balances  \nand equipment data sheets . \n• Working on a FEED stud y implement ing a vapour -liquid separator at one of the UK’s largest \noil refineries. During this project I produced flow diagrams, heat and mass balances, line \nlists, data sheets and worked to appropriate standards to design the separator  vessel . I also \nparticipated in h azard studies such as risk assessments, HAZOPs and HAZIDs.  \n• Updating department tools such as an excel VBA tool which calculates equipment time to \nfailure in the event of a fire.  \n• Liaising with technology vendors, clients and other external personnel to develop projects.  \n• Developing a matrix to identify under -performing wastewater treatment works.  \n• Updating P&ID’s , site standard operating procedures (SOPs)  and other site documentation  \nfor a range of wastewater treatment works.  \n• Creating various design t emplates for use in both the clean water and wastewater sectors.  \n \nProcess / Project Engineer  \nArgent Energy  - SWIRE Group  \nStanlow Refinery, Ellesmere Port, Cheshire  \nJuly 2018 – February 2020   \n \nArgent Energy is currently the largest biodiesel producer in the UK. Having joined the company as \na graduate process project engineer, I quickly progressed into a managerial role in which I  led a \nsmall team responsible for capital expenditure (CapEx)  projects  across two UK sites . The  projects I \nwas involved  with were  a mixture of process improvements, de -bottlenecks and environmentally  \ndriven projects , ranging  from concept studies through to installation. My role comprised of : \n \n• Managing a varie ty of end-to-end projects  up to £300k and leading p roject proposals  up to \n£800k .  \n• Optimising cooling water flow rates to save £180k CapEx  by reducing cooling water \n requirements by circa 50%.  \n• Initiating a debottleneck project which was estimated  to increase annual profits by £120k \nupwards with only a 6 -month payback time.  \n• Representing the Argent Energy Group in front of the Environmental Agency (EA) and the \nScottish Environmental Protection Agency (SEPA) to present updates on environmentally \ndriven projects.  \n• Implementing a process safety culture through either contributing to or leading process \nhazard analyses . \n• Achieving 89% in the 1 -week IChemE Fundamentals of Process Safety training course.   \n• Enhancing knowledge of design methodology and standards through the  1-week  IChemE \nProcess Design Practices training course.  \n• Producing project deliverables such as; project scopes, PFD’s, mass balances, P&ID’s, \nenergy balances, control philosophies, cost -benefit analysis reports, equipment lists, \noptioneering reports and procurement lists.   \n \nPersonal Tutor  \nTutora  & Freelance  \nNottinghamshire/Cheshire  \nJuly 2016 – January 2020  \n \nAs a personal exams tutor, I  tutored GCSE /A-Level math ematic s and chemistry in my spare time . I \nreceived positive feedback and positive exam results from all students.   \n \nQualifications   \nUniversity of Newcastle Upon -Tyne (October 2014 – June 2018)  \nMEng Chemical Engineering  \nDegree Result: First Class (73%)  \nProjects  Undertaken: Completed the BEng multidisciplinary design project  designing a batch \nhydrogenation process . Completed the MEng  research project  exploring process intensification in \nbiodiesel production.  \nAchievements: Awarded the  Sandman Scholarship 2014 -2018  due to academic excellence.  \n \nAshfield Sixth Form (September 2012 – June 2018)  \nA-Level Results: Mathematics (A*), Chemistry (A*), Physics (A), Biology (A)  \nAchievements:   Obtained awards for achieving the best results  overall , and highest grades in \nmathematics  and chemistry.  \n \nAshfield Comprehensive School (September 2007 – June 2012)  \nGCSE Results:  12 A* -B  \nAchievements:  Represented county in track and field . \n \nInterests  \nI am an Associate member of IChemE and have a genuine interest in process engineering. As such, \nI am regularly reading The Chemical Engineer  and researching areas of interest. I  also play 7 -aside \nfootball, go to the gym and socialise with friends and family.  \nAdditional Skills  \nAuto CAD Autoplant P&ID  (Intermediate),  Microsoft Office ( Advanced ), Aspen HYSYS \n(Intermediate ), Aspen Plus (Beginner), MATLAB (Beginner) , Power BI (Beginner)  \nReferences available on request  \n ",
