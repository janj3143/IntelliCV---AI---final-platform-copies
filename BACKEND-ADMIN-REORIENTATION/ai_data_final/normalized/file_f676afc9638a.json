I believe that my experience with human infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and tuberculosis, in addition to the skills that I’ve gained during my more than ten years working in medical research, make me an ideal candidate for this position.

I believe that my experience with human infectious diseases, including COVID-19 and tuberculosis, in addition to the skills that I’ve gained during my more than ten years working in medical research, make me an ideal candidate for this position.   During my post-doctoral research at The Rockefeller University, I worked as part of a team leading the Covid Human Genetics Network (CHGE), a large collaboration between 150+ clinicians and scientists aiming to sequence and identify genetic variants underlying the various forms of SARS-CoV2 infections. This has given me a deep understanding of both the biology and pathology of COVID-19, and of the importance of establishing productive collaborations.  In addition, I have strong working knowledge of tuberculosis and other mycobacterial infections. I have worked closely with a team of American and French scientists and clinicians to study patients with genetic mutations making them highly susceptible to mycobacterial infections. This work has recently led to the discovery of a new gene crucial for protection against tuberculosis, a study of which will soon come out in the prestigious scientific journal Nature Medicine.   My strong communications skills, both verbal and written, would also be of great benefit for the role, as evidenced by more than 20 presentations at national and international conferences, including invited speaker opportunities. I am able to deliver effective educational presentations, as well as communicate complex medical data and medical affairs strategies to stakeholders. My written communications skills are also well evidenced by my publication record, with 11 research and review articles in leading scientific journals, and a further 4 articles under peer review.  I have a proven record of networking, and building and maintaining professional relationships. At The Rockefeller University, I fostered productive collaborations between research hospitals and universities in 6 different countries, recruiting patients for studies on severe infectious diseases. Through this interdisciplinary team of clinicians, scientists and bioinformaticians, we were able to provide a genetic diagnosis for many families suffering from primary immunodeficiencies. As a Medical Science Liaison, these abilities will enable me to establish and develop strong working relationships with a wide range of cross-functional teams, customer groups, and external stakeholders.  I have experience reviewing academic study proposals at The Rockefeller University and the Garvan Institute, as well as research papers. For the last two years I have been an ad-hoc reviewer for the Journal of Clinical Immunology, where I have reviewed a number of research papers, including articles on patients with mycobacterial infections. With this experience, I will be able to robustly review, develop and assess local Oxford Immunotec-sponsored and Investigator Initiated Study proposals.  \nPage 2 I’m particularly excited by the opportunity to join Oxford Immunotec and contribute to the ground-breaking work that you do, making reliable and accurate tests for the diagnosis of infectious diseases. I greatly admire Oxford Imunotec’s adaptability and flexibility, exemplified by the release of the T-SPOT COVID test, an assay to accurately measure the T cell response to SARS-CoV2 structural proteins. The speed with which this test was designed, optimised and produced highlights the strengths and values of the company, including teamwork, maintaining strong relationships and changing outcomes for patients. I believe that my experience and expertise would be a valuable addition to the Oxford Immunotec Medical Affairs team.  Please do not hesitate to reach out if you have any further questions. Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to speaking with you further.   Yours sincerely, Dr. Simon Pelham    \nPage 3 Simon John Pelham, Ph.D \n  Key Skills • Immunology expert – 10+ years research experience and in depth knowledge in general immunology, immunodeficiencies, infectious diseases, haematology, immune signalling and immune-oncology.  • Excellent interpersonal, verbal and written communication skills, with the ability to generate and interpret data to support decision-making, and communicate complex scientific and medical findings to stakeholders.
