There are 7 FCC units in Korea. Most of Korean units are very big in terms of feed rate and catalyst consumption. Asia region is fast growing market for FCC catalyst and Korean refiners are benchmark.\nFCC unit is regarded as very sophisticated and profitable processes in refinery. FCC catalyst sales is highly rely on technical sales activity. Refiners expect Catalyst vendors to be FCC experts-operations, design and catalyst.\nTypically, refiners are very conservative and catalyst change in FCC unit is big event which takes long time and several staged actions. It is key to maintain long term relationship and to be recognized as accountable partner.\nIt is also important to work as a team and have effective communication. The ALB operates world-wide by many team members across the world. And refinery society is small world and reputation is very important.
