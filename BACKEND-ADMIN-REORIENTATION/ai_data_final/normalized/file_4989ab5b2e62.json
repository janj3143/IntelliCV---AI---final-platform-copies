Besides engineering work, I am providing technical support to other projects and concept studies of Worley, acting as lead engineer, mentoring of junior process engineers.\nRas Markaz Tank Terminal in Oman. Client: OTTCO\nIn this project I was acting as Lead Process Engineer to provide estimation of the required tank volumes, pumps capacities and utilities (fire water, flares, boil off gases refrigeration system, diesel generator, etc.) for safe operation of the Terminal. Product range includes Crude, Diesel, Gasoline, and also cryogenic storage for LPG, LNG and Ammonia.\nNGL Fractionation and Product Treatment Plant in UAE. Client: ADNOC\nIn this project I was acting as Senior Process Engineer within a team of 4 process engineers. In absence of lead engineer, I was acting as deputy lead. Our team developed Concept for the greenfield NGL fractionation plant with inhouse calculation of fractionation unit in HYSYS (Deethaniser, Depropaniser, Debutaniser, Deheptaniser) and treatment units in ProTreat (amine treatment, physical solvent treatment of regeneration gases) including assessment of required utilities. Hydraulic of a complex NGL network was done by me in TLNet software.\nILF Consulting Engineers (Abu Dhabi, UAE)\t\t\t\t\tMar, 2018 – Dec, 2022\nSenior Process Engineer\nILF Consulting Engineers (UAE subsidiary) is an engineering company that provides consultancy to oil and gas, upstream and midstream industries in the Middle East Region. Besides engineering work, I am providing technical input to proposals, man hour estimation, leading of group of process engineers, mentoring of junior process engineers.\nGas Gathering and Compression Project in Wafra oilfield in Kuwait. Client: Wafra Joint Operations (Saudi Arabian Chevron and Kuwait Gulf Oil Company)\nIn this project I was acting as Lead Process Engineer with a team of 3 process engineers and 3 drafters. The team developed FEED for the gas gathering system of 120 MMscfd capacity by VRUs installed on 15 well sites and processing facilities. Gas is gathered in one location via network of piping across the oilfield (total length approx. 50 km) and supplied to compressors. Compression unit consists of 4 trains of 3-stage reciprocating compressors with total motor power 6 MW followed by TEG Dehydration Unit. Facility includes 2 flares and Incinerator. Hydraulic model in HYSYS was developed and technical solutions for installation of seal drums were proposed by me.\nConcept Study of Reactivation/Expansion of Humpuss Aromatic Refinery in Indonesia. Client: Liberty Energy Group.\nThe project was executed in ILF Vienna office (Austria) where I was temporarily assigned to. The 70,000 bpd refinery consists of crude distillation unit, naphtha hydrotreater, reformer, isomerization unit. For a proposed expansion of the existing refinery, I developed a linear regression Aspen PIMS model. This is linear regression model which optimizes refinery configuration based on product’s price and feedstock costs.\nOptimization Study of the Inlet Separators, Amine Unit (MDEA) and Dehydration Unit (TEG) in Sheberghan Gas Field in Afghanistan. Client: Ministry of Mining and Petroleum of Afghanistan.\nDuring the project I was acting as a Senior Process Engineer and led a team of 2 process engineers. We analyzed the existing facilities, identified bottlenecks and design issues of the units. Upon implementation, gas throughput of the Amine Unit will increase from 0.3 to 1 MMm3/d (e.g. relocation of pressure control point, filtering of amine solution, modification of reboiler control loop). Overall capacity of gas plant will increase to 2 MMm3/d of gas by installation of a new Amine Unit and modification of the existing Dehydration Unit. 38 sensitivity cases were conducted in HYSYS to define maximum capacity of the existing units with proposed modifications. Also, new HC/amine drain system and incinerator of acid gas were proposed. I mentored junior process engineer and guided other process engineers in utility systems design.\nConcept Study of Petrochemical Complex in Basrah Governorate, Iraq. Client: Ministry of Industry and Minerals of Iraq.\nI performed the technology screening of polyethylene and polypropylene units, located downstream of Steam Cracker with production capacity of 1,100 kt/a of ethylene and 650 kt/a of propylene. Performed compilation of the Basis of Design. Responsible for estimation of utilities (air, nitrogen, power, etc.) for the Petrochemical Complex and required storage capacity for every final product.\nConcept Design of Tank Farm for Petrol/Diesel, LPG and Edible Oil with SPM Import/Export Pipelines in Berbera, Somalia. Client: Dahabshiil Group.\n12” SPM pipeline for petrol/diesel along with two 10” pipelines for LPG and edible oil was calculated based on Pipeline Studio TLNet simulation. Steady-state and transient cases were performed to identify design pressure and valves closure time. Tank terminal with three independent sectors (petrol/diesel, LPG and edible oil) total 92,000 m3 with truck loading/unloading facilities was designed to fulfill export requirements of 1,000 m3 per hour of petrol/diesel, 500 m3 per hour for LPG and 700 m3 per hour for edible oil. I utilized HYSYS Hydraulics for simulation of terminal’s piping and transfer / loading pumps. Special care was taken for pipeline and piping heating for edible oil sector to prevent palm oil solidification.\nFeasibility Study for Replacement and Improvement of the Existing Gas Network in Dhaka City, Bangladesh. Client: Titas Gas Transmission and Distribution Co. Ltd.\nClient owns the gas distribution network which was constructed in stages starting 1970s. Gas network supplies districts of Dhaka City and number of power plants around the city. In the project I was responsible for development of overall network SFD, and PFDs of each station inside the network (total more than 50), establishing of Design Basis. Each station consists of pressure reduction streams for each downstream consumer, heating and filtering units, drain system.\nProject Management Consultancy Service for Green Riyadh Project – Water Supply Increase to Riyadh City, Saudi Arabia. Client: Royal Commission of Riyadh City.\nThis Mega Project aimed to increase area of green zones of Riyadh City from 2% to 10%.
