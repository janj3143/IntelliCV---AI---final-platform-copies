Manage and lead complex technical \ndiscussions with third parties (Customers, Licensors, and Suppliers) in order to facilitate appropriate technical \ndecisions. Identify issues (problems, value improvement opportunities) and help clarify areas of complexity \nduring all phases of the engineering design and execution work.  \nAs Process Discipline Manag er, I have lead a team of process engineers in execution of 4 major projects as \nshown below:  \na. TOTAL Ar Ratawi Project, Iraq ($100 MM) : \nThe project looked at valorization of gas from existing central processing facilities rather than flaring. \nIt was based on standard skid module designing and optimized approach widely used in the Oil and \nGas Industry. Facility consisted mainly of Inlet Separation, Acid Gas Removal Unit with Incinerator, \nHydrocarbon Dew Point Unit with C3 Refrigeration Unit, Sal es Gas Compression along with necessary \nutilities such as Hot Oil, Fuel Gas, Instrument Air, Power Gensets ….etc.  \nEssential Duties & Responsibilities includes:  \n• Managing planning and discipline manhours of process deliverables  \n• Pre Bid/Post Bid Clarifications  \n• Value Engineering and effective participation in safety studies such as HAZID, HAZOP and \nLOPA  \n• Review of key vendor packages and duty specifications  \n \nb. Basrah Gas NGL Project, Iraq ($200 MM) :  \nThe Gas Growth Project Basrah NGL Facilities covers the installation of Gas Receiving facilities, Acid \nGas Removal and Sulphur Recovery facilities, Cryogenic NGL extraction and export facilities with a \ntotal capacity of 400 MMscfd of feed gas. The Project adapted  the use of replicated, standard, pre -\nengineered gas treating and NGL extraction designs, modularized to a high degree, as widely used \nin the NGL industry and adjusted where needed to process the feed gas composition specified . \nEssential Duties & Re sponsibilities includes : \n• Managed Planning and discipline Man Hours as per deliverables list to meet Project Schedule  \n• Liaise with Customer for key meetings leading to Project Completion and Delivery  \n• Overlooked and guided Lead/Senior engineers in Safety Stud ies such as Design Review, \nHAZOP, SIL, SIMOPS, Alarm Management  \n• Defined List of Malfunctions and Operating scenario’s for Operator Training Simulator (OTS)  \n• Handled Management of Change and Variation Orders   \n \nc. Pearl Petroleum Project, Kurdistan Iraq ($400  MM):  \nPearl Petroleum Company Ltd (Pearl) produces gas at Kor Mor with an existing plant capacity of \napproximately 400 MMSCFD of Sales Gas . Pearl Petroleum plann ed to expand capacity by adding a \nnumber of plants each with a capacity of 525 MMSCFD of sales  gas. Each plant had two processing \ntrains  catering to 262.5 MMSCFD max sales gas production . Essential Duties & Responsibilities \nincludes : \n• Managed Planning and discipline Man Hours as per deliverables list  \n• Liaised with Customer in critical meetings as well as contributed to key decision making in \nvalue proposition for project  \n• Guided Lead/Senior engineers during safety studies  \n Bashrie Dias CEng MIChemE                            linkedin.com/in/bashrie -dias-ceng-micheme -\n0622a317/  \nPROCESS DISCIPLINE MANAGER  \n • Reviewed 3D model / layout plans in terms of 30%,60% and 90%  \n• Actively participated  in defining key attributes for OTS, prepared Alarm Management \nPhilosophy and assisted Lead/Senior Engineer for closure of HAZOP/SIL actions  \n \nd. OQ Bisat C Production Facility Project : \nOQ Exploration and Production (OQ) operates Bisat – Shuaiba reservoir that predominantly consists \nof Oil, Produced Water and minimal Associated Gas. OQ currently operates 2(two) Early Production \nFacilities (EPF) that handles 120K SBPD of gross liquid and oil capacity of 25K SBPD . OQ plan to \nexpand its handling capacity due to li mitation on its existing EPFs by adding a new Production facility \nto process 500K SBPD of gross liquid and oil capacity of 50K SBPD.  Essential Duties & Responsibilities \nincludes : \n• Managed planning and discipline Man Hours  \n• Chaired internal Design Review sess ion with peers in order to target value proposition for \nproject  \n• Handled Technical Query/Technical Addendums/Variation Orders successfully  \n• Guided Lead/Senior engineering during safety studies   \n \n2. ADNOC Gas, Abu Dhabi, UAE    \nAt ADNOC Gas, I worked as Lead Process Energy Optimization Engineer and associated with Technical \nEngineering Services Group to support Operations and Business development. My role is to carry out analyses \nof key Energy Performance Indicators (EnPIs) for all production plants and suppor t ISO 50001 certification. \nCarry out comprehensive energy efficiency studies within processing plant and check feasibility of \nimplementation via discussions with specialist and technology experts. Essential Duties & Responsibilities \nincludes : \n• Implement app ",
