Indu strial placement with British Sugar (2006 -2007) . \nProfessional History  \n \nTotal  / Prax  (Lindsey Oil Refinery) –Process Safety Engineer  – September 2016 to Current   \n \nProvision of  process safety support to the refinery operations. Areas of activity include  the following : \n \n• Facilitation of safety studies (HAZOP, LOPA)  and process safety  risk assessments . \n• TUV (Rheinland) certif ied functional safety engineer.  \n• Supporting refinery to better align to IE C 61511 requirements for functional safety management, inclusive \nof writing refinery standards and guides on LOPA and SRS preparation.  \n• Mana gement and organis ation  of the refinery’s retrospective HAZOP and LOPA programmes , inclusive \nof appointment via competitive tender of a 3rd party contractor  to independently facilitate the studies . \nProvided process safety input to the studies  and acted as study scribe.  \n• Recognised  competent person on site for reviewing management of change proposals from a process \nsafety perspective , inclusive of active participate  in multidisciplinary design review, project risk \nassessments , and participat ion and facilitat ion of  safety studies (HAZOP, LOPA) to support the \nmanagement of change processes. Significant projects include air -gapping of redundant unit and \nconversion of a distillate hydrotreater to alternative feedstocks.  \n• Provided  process safety support to several major  projects on the refinery, including air -gapping  of \nredundant units  and a major project to convert a distillate hydrotreater to a heavier feedstock.  \n• Experience managing  the refinery process safety KPI suite using recognised industry standards such as  \nHSG 254 and API RP 754.  \n• Member of refinery crisis management team  \n• Trained internal auditor and conducts  audits o n refinery systems  \n• Analysis of risk via fault and event tree preparation  \n• Preparation of ALARP arguments  on various refinery operation , inclusive  of cost benefit analysis.  \n \nTotal (Lindsey Oil Refinery) – Senior Process Engineer Investigations – Zone 1&3 - August 2014 to \nSeptember 2016  \n \nManaged  a team of six or more Process Engineers . Responsible  for developing the  team and ensure that they \nprovided  all the process engineering support , troubleshooting, optimisation and process development  for the \nrefinery’s hydroskimming section , utilities complex, offsites area and the refinery’s energy consumption.  Notable \nachievements in the role incl uded the following:   \n \n• Managed  team through a substantial refinery wide business restructuring project. , inclusive of site \nheadcount reduction  \n \n • Identified technical challenges arising from the restructuring within my area. Commissioned team to \nresolve identi fied threats . \n• Was technical  lead for the procurement and s electi on of new hydrotreater catalyst  \n• Led my team in scope preparation for a major turnaround and inspection , specifying required process \nclean and catalyst replacements. Work also  inclusive of providing process engineering support for a \nsignificant furnace revamp project.  \n• Participated in m anagement of change reviews  from a process engineering perspective , inclusive of \nverification of process information.  \n \nTotal (Lindsey Oil Refin ery) – Process Engineer Investigations – Stage 1  – September 2013 to August 2014  \n \nProvided  process engineering support to one of the Refinery’s hydroskimming trains . Day to day duties in the role \nwere to provide optimisation and pro cess troubleshooting expertise for these process units. Notable areas of \nactivity include d the following : \n \n• Facilitation of  root cause analys es  \n• Participation  in a m ajor turnaround and inspectio n, carrying out vessel inspections and supervising \ncatalyst loading and  the re -tray of a debutaniser column.  \n• Verified  the performance of re-trayed debutaniser column performance  via performance trials , inclusive \nof presentation of results to refiner y management and Corporate  experts.  \n• Organised  and supervised  a catalyst change  of a naphtha hydrotreater . Led the process from \nidentification of problem through to the successful start -up of the unit on completion of the works .  \n \nTotal (Lindsey Oil Refinery) – Performance Control Engineer  – May 2010 to September 2013  \n \nProvided  economical optimisation support to refinery . Notable responsibilities included  the following : \n \n• Led weekly multi -disciplinary meetings to discuss process  optimisation.  \n• Prepared and presented material for the monthly optimisation committee , comprised of a m ixture of  \nrefinery and corporate audience . \n• Worked with refinery linear programme (LP) model. Was r esponsible for model accuracy and verified \nthe accuracy of new releases via carrying out simulation exercises. Tasks included l iaison with central \ncoding team and other LP users . Wrote refinery guide  on simulation exercised.  \n• Carried  out economic assessment s, using tools such as the LP model, to quantify financial losses from \nshutdowns and identify future opportunities.  \n• Trained and temporarily managed a new technical clerk within the section.  \n \nTotal (Lindsey Oil Refinery) – Process Engineer Investigations – Offsites  - September 2009 to May 2010  \n \nProvided process engineering support for the refinery’s sour water system and offsites facilities, inclusive of the \naqueous effluent treatment. Work required the satisfying of environmental constraints without impacting overall \nrefinery optimisation.  \n \nINTERESTS AN D ACTIVITIES  \n \nEnjoy exploring new places with my young family and friends. With home ownership, have developed an interest \nin gardening and DIY. Take a keen interest in sports, particularly cricket .  \n \nOTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION  \n \nHave good working knowledge of computer software, such as Microsoft Office  and various Process Safety \nspecific applications such as ABB SafetyInsight, PHA Pro  and Isograph Reliability Workbench .  \n \nI hold a full UK driving license  \n \nReferences  \n \nAvailable on request  \n ",
