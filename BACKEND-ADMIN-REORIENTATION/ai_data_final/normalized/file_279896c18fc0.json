The radiators need to be connected by \npipework which allows good flow; heat pumps \nrequire the water in your radiators to \nmove quicker.\nYour installer will need to check and assess \nyour pipework to ensure it is suitable (this is \nanother reason is it important to make sure \nyou have insulated your property). If you choose an air source heat \npump consider that this will need to \nbe outside - generally in your garden, \nclose to your house. \naroTHERM plusWith regular servicing, a \nwell installed heat pump \nshould last over 15 yearsIt is important that your \ninstaller thoroughly assesses \nthe heating and hot water \nrequirements of the property to \nselect the correct size of heat pump \nand heating system, and get the best \nperformance.\nThey will need to complete a survey \nand heat loss calculation  of the \nbuilding to do this. !What is a heat loss \ncalculation?\nThe installer will visit you to review and \nassess the fabric of your property, using \na calculation method called MIS 3005  \nto complete a room-by-room heat loss \ncalculation.\nThis will show how much heat each of \nyour home’s rooms require to keep \nwarm in the middle of winter - this is \nknown as the peak heating requirement.\nThe installer will then recommend \nany changes to your system, possibly \nreplacing radiators, the size of hot water \ncylinder and the size of the heat pump \nyour property needs to keep you warm \nand comfortable. 3\n15 \nyears\nMore information and funding\nWhen is the heat pump \ngrant available?\nAs part of this announcement, \n‘The Boiler Upgrade Scheme’ , \nhomeowners in England and \nWales will be offered subsidies \nof £5,000 from April 2022 to \nhelp them replace gas boilers \nwith low carbon heat pumps.\nWe are awaiting further details \non what the requirements will \nbe to obtain the funding.Where can I go to find out \nmore information about heat \npumps?\nHomeowners considering a heat pump \nshould review www.vaillant.co.uk  for \nmore information and if they wish to \ngo ahead quickly, they can find a local \ninstaller for their heat pump system.\nWill the £5,000 grant cover all costs, \nincluding installation?\nOnce your installer has completed the site survey and \ncompleted the MIS 3005 calculations they will be able to \noffer you a quote.\nCurrently, it is unlikely that the £5,000 will cover the \nfull costs  of your new heating system installation. This \nwill vary from home to home and the amount of work \nrequired, however, you should be prepared to make a \ncontribution to your heat pump system. \naroTHERM plus\nDo Vaillant have a \nhydrogen boiler?\nAll of our boilers are ready for \na 20% mix of hydrogen with \nnatural gas.\nWe have a 100% hydrogen-\ncompatible solution currently in \ndevelopment.\nWe expect a decision on \nhydrogen for heating from the \ngovernment by 2026.Is there anything else that \nshould be considered? \nThe boiler upgrade scheme is going \nto be available for 3 years from \nApril 2022 .\nIf your home is currently unsuitable \nspeak with your MCS installer as well as \nvisiting the Energy Saving Trust  to see \nwhat improvements you can make to \nmake your home low-carbon ready. \nIs the Renewable Heat Incentive \n(RHI) scheme still available?\nWhen the RHI scheme ends in March 2022, \nwe expect this to be replaced by the  \nBoiler Replacement Scheme .5\nVaillant Group UK Ltd  \nNottingham Road  \nBelper, Derbyshire  \nDE56 1JT\nwww.vaillant.co.uk\nFollow Vaillant UK on\nVaillant_home VALB2CHBS1021With its first-rate service, Vaillant can make life more comfortable \nbefore your new heating system has even been installed. \nThe first person to contact is, of course, your heat pump engineer \nwho will provide expert advice on all of the technical aspects.
