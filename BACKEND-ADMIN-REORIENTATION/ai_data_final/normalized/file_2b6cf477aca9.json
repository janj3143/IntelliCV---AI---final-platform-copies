It is perfect for additional hot water  \nrequirements in in larger homes or small  \nbusinesses where there is a high hot water \ndemand.\nThis heat pump cylinder is incredibly efficient \nand sustainable, using thermal energy to  \nheat hot water. This thermal energy can be  \ncollected via an external air duct, or it can \nrecycle hot air from within the room where \nit’s installed, provided there is sufficient \nventilation. The only other energy needed  \nis the electricity to run the appliance.aroSTOR domestic hot water heat pump\nHeat source Air\nUsage New buildings, renovation, replacement\nSize 200 and 270ltr\nAmount of usable hot water367 and 495ltrs  \n*based on stored water at 65°C\nEnergy efficiency A+\nHow heat pump technology works \nGround source heat pumps extract thermal energy (heat) from the ground via horizontal \nor vertical collectors buried in the ground. Ground source heat pumps are highly efficient \nand require more planning considerations than air source heat pumps. Horizontally \ninstalled collectors require a large amount of land to bury the refrigerant pipes, collecting \nthe thermal energy, approximately 1.2m below the surface. Vertical collectors, on the  \nother hand, require a deep borehole to be drilled to extract the heat from around 100m  \ndeep into the earth.\nWater source heat pumps can draw thermal energy (heat) from water. Extracting heat  \nfrom water requires access to lakes, wells or streams. The temperature of water is \nconstant regardless of the season and the outside temperature making this heat \nsource highly efficient although, like the ground source heat pump, requires more  \nplanning considerations than an air source heat pump. \nAir source (also known as air-to-water) heat pumps have an outdoor unit that extracts \nthermal energy (heat) from the surrounding air and converts this into heating and hot \nwater. Air source heat pumps require a small amount of outdoor space connected to \nan indoor module and a cylinder if hot water is required. As air is an easily accessible \nsource of energy it is a less expensive option than using ground or water source heat \npumps and is suitable for most property types in the UK.\nAir\nEarth\nWaterHP18_6512 3_01 aroTHERM Split, VIH RW\nflexoCOMP ACT exclusive; fluoCOLLECT  ground wate r HP15_62747_01flexoCOMP ACT exclusive; soil HP15_62748_01HP11_663 5_01 geoTHERMHeat pumps use environmental energy to generate heating and hot water for your home.
