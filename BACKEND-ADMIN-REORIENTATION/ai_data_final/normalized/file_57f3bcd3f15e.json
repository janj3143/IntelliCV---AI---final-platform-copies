He is a Chartered Engineer with over 30 years’ experience across the offshore gas, LNG, air separation and energy industries.  His experience covers a range of senior roles including project director, technical director, project development, proposal management and direction, and consultancy, and includes all stages of project development from bid stage through conceptual design, detail engineering design, construction and commissioning.\nAndy is recognised by clients for his project leadership, technical expertise, business acumen, collaborative working approach and track record in delivery on both large and small complex projects and for maintaining a strong focus on delivery whilst successfully balancing the requirements of quality, cost, schedule and safety.  In his last 14 years at KBR, he has worked in senior roles on multiple studies, FEEDs and EPCs and been closely involved in the pursuit and winning of new work. On Chevron’s Gorgon LNG mega project, he was Technical and Quality Director during EPC in the project directorate with overall technical and quality accountability across 6 global joint venture project offices. The project remains one of the world’s largest grassroots projects and also one of the most complex and challenging given its remote and environmentally sensitive location.\nDuring the last 9 years he has driven much of the floating LNG development work at KBR, delivering a range of novel engineering solutions for multiple FLNG and Gravity Based Structure (GBS) LNG projects.  These included GDF Suez’s Bonaparte FLNG project, Eni’s Mozambique Coral South FLNG project and Rosneft’s Pechora LNG and ranged in value from $4-6 billion. He is highly knowledgeable in the technology, engineering design and project execution strategies and in particular modularisation, which is critical to all these projects.\nUp until June last year he spent 20 months as Deputy Project Director on Woodside’s Browse project responsible for the engineering delivery and execution planning for two very large and complex offshore gas FPSOs. The design for Browse had many novel elements and pushed new boundaries in digital execution and remote operations strategy. Alongside the project work, Andy was instrumental in helping to secure the FEED and EPm work under competitive tender. This work is currently on hold as the global LNG market re-adjusts.\nAndy is a regular speaker on FLNG design and execution at numerous international conferences and seminars, including Gastech, Flame, Russia LNG Congress and GPA Europe. He has twice facilitated the FLNG World Congress conference in Singapore and is recognised as a global industry expert on the subject.\nPrior to KBR, Andy spent 10 years with Air Products, firstly as Process Technology Manager, responsible for the process and control teams developing and building a range of cryogenic air separation plants for global clients, and secondly as a Project Development Manager responsible for developing new opportunities for large air separation plants globally, working closely with the sales team.\nAndy started his career in energy consultancy with WS Atkins spending much of his 8 years there designing and constructing CO2 recovery and liquefaction systems for numerous large breweries.\nSUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS\nBEng (Hons.)

In 2006 I was approached to join the LNG group at KBR where I have spent the last 14 years delivering projects from small-scale leading-edge studies to the largest and most complex mega projects in the world. The notable difference at KBR compared with my time at Air Products has been the scale and value of the largest LNG and offshore projects for which the budgets and size of teams have been considerably larger. Working at a leadership level on these projects, transferable skills I would bring to the role at Air Products include:\nDetailed project execution planning for all project phases and setting up organisation structures required to deliver large projects; the leadership team for mega projects requires highly experienced personnel in each of the key roles. A large project may have a FEED team of 250 people and this will double to 500 people in EPC. The Gorgon mega-project had over 2000 people in engineering across 6 offices during detailed design. This requires considerable management effor",
