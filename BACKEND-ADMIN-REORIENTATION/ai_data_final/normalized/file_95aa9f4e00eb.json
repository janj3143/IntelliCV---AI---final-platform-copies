Independently \nproduced deliverables for the detailed design of the fermentation unit and plant layout.  \n2006–2013  Macclesfield High School/ College  \n  A Level s – Mathematics (B), Chemistry (B), Biology (B)  \n  AS Level s – Product Design (B)  \n  GCSE s – 14 (2A*, 6A, 6B) including Maths and English  \nRelevant  Experience            \nAug 2019  – Present   Process  Engineer – Wood PLC  \nDeveloped my core process engineering competencies on two world scale FEED project s; designing \na Natural Gas Fractionation facility to be built in the Middle East  and a separate PMC role on a project  \nto design a n olefin complex in Belgium.   Currently d eveloping a company -wide framework for \nembedding  sustainab ility and reliab ility within  infrastructure projects.  \n• Performed process adequacy studies on two existing NGL fractionation facilities to process a \nchange in feed composition and capacity; developing pro cess simulations to benchmark \nagainst equipment design and identify inadequacies.  \n• Developed  and reviewed key engineering deliverables , such as; Basis of Design (BOD) , \nProcess Flow Diagrams ( PFD), Piping and Instrumentation Diagrams ( P&ID ) and Datasheets . \n• Performed several technology evaluation process  studies , including;  licensed sulphur removal \nunits  for various feeds  and a detailed  Spent Caustic Treatment Technology evaluation . \n• HAZOP scribed (remotely) for several different process areas , including license r units, \nproducing HAZOP reports and implementing outcome actions.  \n• Performed utility system configuration studies due to major reconfiguration of project scope.  \nSept 2017 – Aug 2019  Graduate Engineer – Affinity Water  \nGained valuable experience u ndertaking a range of  roles and projects within a graduate scheme.  \nProcess Optimisation P roject  \n• Lead a process optimisation project assessing  the performance of  a potable  water treatment \nsite in terms of operating costs, process and product quality.  Established a methodology that \nhas been adopted as the standard approach by other  optimisation engineers . \n• Produced a series of solutions to mitigate inefficiencies concerning p ower, product quality and \nwaste production, e.g. installing a bypass to reduce waste product and power usage.  \n• Performed process modelling through mass/flow balances to simulate scenarios to quantify \nsavings and understand the risk of identified potential  optimisation s. \n• Performed onsite tests (jar tests) to assess the performance of the sludge separating units \nand i nitiated a trial to assess a novel rotary sludge thickening unit to reduce waste volumes.  \n• Provided onsite technical support to operators continuing the maintenance of optimal settings.  \nHS2 Water Treatment Project  \n• Working on the design and installation of ultra-filtration treatment plants within the HS2  \nprocess  design team.  \n• Reviewing design drawings  and documents,  including P&IDs, PFDs , mass  balances and \ncontrol philosophies,  ensuring they comply with company standards.   \n• Performing hydraulic design calculations for pump sizing.  \nEnergy Strategy P roject  \n• Implement ed a companywide scheme to make energy savings, analysing future requirements \nfor alternative energy technologies/ renewables.  \n• Involved in the i mplement ation of  innovative pump efficiency  technologies  resulting in reduced \nenergy usage and a payback period less than a year.  \nJuly – Aug 2017  Grad uate Researcher Summer Position – M&I Materials  \n• Involved in the commissioning of a 10 ML batch ester product ion plant, analysing trends to \nassess the performance of the process.  \n• Contributed to the design and feasibility study of a modular ester production plant . \nJune – Sept 2016  Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) – The \nUniversity of Sheffie ld \n• Awarded the competitive SURF award to develop a platform technology for protein secretion \nin E. Coli, through gene insertion . My work is to be included in a professional publication.  \n• Objective  was to increase production efficiency and reduce costs  for indu strial applications.  \n• Successfully achieved  a 3-fold increase in secretion rate over what is already implemented.  \n• Presented my findings via a presentation and poster at a showcase and produced a  report.   \nAdditional Skills  and Experience          \n• Experienced with Aspen Hysys simulations on several projects.  \n• Skilled in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and SharePoint.  \n• Experience with telemetry , GIS  and Laboratory Information Management Systems.  \n• Full and clean driving licence . \n• Won first place in the Associate of Project Management Challenge 2020, initiating and \ndeveloping an info pack and lesson to educate children on sustainable growing.  \nTraining             \n• APM Project Management training  course . \n• Phoenix H&S in Management training  (IOSH accredited) . \n• Arcadis intensive two day pump training . \n• Various soft skill training sessions  and in -house technical consistency training modules . \nHobbies  and Interests           \n• A keen sportsman with an interest in rock climbing, snowboar ding a nd 5-a-side football . \n• IChemE associate member , currently working towards Chartership . \n• Actively contribute to company charity and volunteer initiatives; winning an award for ‘Best \nInnovation in the WaterAid Winnovators challenge 2018 and developing training materials for \nyoung professionals as a volunteer committee member of the Wood ‘Early Career s Network’.  \nReferees  – Available upon reques t \n ",
