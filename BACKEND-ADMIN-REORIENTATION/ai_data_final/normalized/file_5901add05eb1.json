After gaining useful experience in project engineering and draughting roles, I  opted \nto focus on the safety and reliability aspects of engineering.  I have since gained  experience  across multiple sectors  \nin both perma nent roles  and fixed  term contracts via my limited company  (Millenable ). In addition, I am actively \nworking towards achieving  Chartered Engineer (CEng) status with the Institution of Engineering and Technology \n(IET).  \nProfessional  Experience  \nSystem Safety Engineer at Expleo      January  2021 to Present  \nI provide  direct system safety engineering support to two of Expleo’s major engineering clients in the defence \nsector  (via s eparate contracts) . The  first contract  focussed on  the functional and physical safety aspects associated \nwith a ‘future submarine’ programme, which was in t he 'Manufacturing' phase of the CADMID cycle. I produced \nkey safety deliverables, such as hazard log updates and the generation of Design Safety Justification (DSJ) reports, \nwithin extremely tight timeframes . In addition,  I supplied weekly progress reports  to my client (Expleo), which \nthey utilised to inform their key stakeholders (within Expleo's client's organisation) during high -level meetings. I \nreceived outstandingly positive feedback from the key stakeholders with regards to my overall contribution to  the \nsystem safety aspects of the 'future submarine' programme.  \nThe second cont ract currently f ocusses on the non -functional (physical), functional, and operational safety aspects \nassociated with a  ‘mine countermeasures ’ system of systems , whic h is currently in the ‘Demonstration ’ and \n‘Manufacturing ’ phases of the CADMID cycle, depending on the specific sub -system in question. I manage the \noverarching hazard log for the e ntire programme. In addition, I chair hazard log review meetings and ensure that \nrelevant actions are follow -up in a timely manner. I also attend site meetings , on the request of Expleo ’s client, \nwhen requ ired and report my findings to the Programme Lead(s) . I supply weekly progress reports to my client \n(Expleo) , which contri butes to Expleo ’s progress reports to their client.  \nSafety Engineer at Babcock International Group    September  2019 to December 2020  \nI provided system safety engineering services as contingent resource to the Safety Services Group (SSG), who \nsupport Babcock’s Engineering Delivery Group (EDG) in delivering design changes to the MoD, with occasional \ntravel to MoD Abbey Wood to attend key safety -related meetings. Prior to scribing  and/or co-chairing these \nmeetings, I produced Hazard Identification and Assessment (HIA) briefing packs, w hich included  Environmental \nImpact Screening and Scoping (EISS), in preparation for stimulating relevant di scussions and recording the main \noutcomes. I also drafted the primary deliverable(s); the  subsequent Safety and Environmental Assessment Report \n(SEAR)  for the design change under assessment . \nOther activities I completed during this contract included (but w ere not limited to): Project management activities, \nincluding liaising with MoD/SSMG task owners to arrange meetings and ensuring that project deliverables are \nproduced to the correct specifications and in accordance with the project delivery schedule; Rev iew of safety \ndeliverables produced by Babcock Energy and Marine (E&M) and BMT; Updating Safety Summary Reports \n(SSRs); Using SSMG applications, including Soter, R -DAR and Design Change; and mentoring other team \nmembers, including new graduates (as part of  the Babcock Engineering Graduate Scheme), by assigning tasks, \nmonitoring progress, and providing useful feedback.  \nSafety Consultant at BMT       December 201 8 to July 2019  \nI was responsible for producing Safety and Environmental Case Reports (SECRs) for eq uipment used on surfaced \nmaritime platforms with a UK defence application. I liaised directly with clients and attended at Project Safety \nand Environmental Committee (PSEC) meetings within the capacity of an active team/project member and \n\nmeeting scribe. I  subsequently produced associated equipment hazard logs (often during meetings on client \nagreement) and further analysis as required, using the following techniques: Event Tree Analysis (ETA); Fault \nTree Analysis (FTA); and Failure Modes Effects and Critic ality Analysis (FMECA).  \nSafety Engineer  at Quorum Logistic Support Limited    December 2017 to September 2018  \nI was the in -house safety Subject Matter Expert (SME) for several  land-based defence projects during a six -month \ncontract, in which I was granted an extension due to client demand. I also lent my numerical aptitude to various \nprojects by completing tasks associated with calculating the availability of safety/mission cri tical systems. I \ncontributed to maintenance task analysis by manoeuvring myself into confined spaces under/within a recovery \nvehicle to complete the required work, while being temporarily based at the supplier’s site in southwest Germany. \nI further contrib uted to the aforementioned project by producing technical illustrations  using Inkscape v.0.93 , \nwhich formed part of the requirement to produce installation and operating manuals.  \nFunctional Safety Engineer at Northrop Grumman Sperry Marine   October 2016 to  August 2017  \nI completed tasking on two su bmarine projects,  both with de rived safety requirements equivalent to SIL 2 . Both \nprojects were alig ned with  IEC 61508 and Defence Standard 00 -056. I reviewed technical d ocumentation and  \nprovided evidence  (where available) that the  Platform Management System (PMS) was complia nt with SIL 2 and \nhighlighted any gaps. I also managed the hazard management actions  associated with one of the projects  in a \ndatabase  and chaired weekly progress meetings to support this activity . In addition , I generated and maintained \nSQEP competence levels for all personnel  involved in both projects.  \nSystems Safety Engineer at CDS Defence      September 2015 to October 2016  \nI co-chaired client -facing  Safety Panel Meeti ngs (SPMs) and analysed System risk , in terms of frequency and \nseverity,  of in -service equipment.  I produced Safety Case Reports (SCR s) and reviewed other s ystem s afety \nengineers ’ reports . I also produced in -depth Fault Tree Analysis (FTA)  for a ship -based Missile System. On the \nurgent request of one of CDS Defence ’s clients, I demonstrated via c alculation that the Individual Risk Per  Annum \n(IRPA ) was within acceptable  limits for personnel conducting a specified Operation . I recovered an overdue \nproject, acting as system safety engineer and project manager (with senior oversight), as described in the ‘Notable \nProject ’ section in this CV.  \nJunior Consultant at Enginee ring Safety Consultants     August 2014 to September 2015  \nI received training , and subsequently pr actised, the following techni ques: HAZID; HAZOP; SIL Determination  \n(using LOPA); SIL Verification; Consequence Mo delling ( such as Event Tree Ana lysis (ETA) and  the use of \nPHAST); FTA (including the use of Reliability Workbench ); and Functional Safety A ssess ment (FSA) to IEC \n61508.  I scribed numerous client -facing studies , which included HAZID, HAZOP, SIL Determination , FMECA \nand FSA , and produced the subsequent reports . \nJunior Draughtsman at Awali      June 2014 to August 2014  \nThis was a short contract position  based on Awali ’s client ’s requirements . I produced general arrangements, \nisometrics , and P&IDs using AutoCAD . I reviewed and commented on drawings pro duced by others on behalf of \nAwali.  \nProject Engineer at Weatherford      October 2012 to June 2014  \nThis was my first permanent position following my graduation . The role i ncludes a combination of project and \nprocess engineering tasking, which in cluded international travel in support of numerous projects for various \nclients in the Oil and Gas sec tor. In doing so, I co -ordinated client -witnessed Factory Accepta nce Tests ( FATs ) \nof major equipment packages across three projects simultaneously.  I completed all project tasks  to tight deadlines, \nincluding  (but not limited  to) risk registers ; PFD/P&ID mark -ups and draughting ; HAZID  studies ; HAZOP  \nstudies ; RFQs ; and subsequent bid tabulation, procedures, specifications, project schedules , etc.  \n  \nUndergraduate Placement Student at DPS (Bristol)     June 2010 to September 2011  \nAs part of my MEng Chemical Engineering  (Hons)  I completed an Indu strial Placement Year, during which I \nworked within the Resea rch and Deve lopment department on the in -house development and testing phases of \nDPS’ products. I was also heavily  involve d in the HAZO P and onsite testing of waste to energy units , also \ncontributing to technical clarification meetings .
