Excellent communication and interpersonal skills couple d with an ability to \nwork effectively both individually and collaboratively as part of a team when required: thriving in challenging and fast -\nmoving environments by prioritising tasks and targets with strong time management skills and exceptional work disc ipline . \nExperience in engineering, consulting, and data analysis through internships at the Royal Navy, Bright Network and Lab \nTechnician.  \nEDUCATION & QUALIFICATION  \nIntegrated Masters’ in Chemical Engineering | University of Leeds , 2016-2020  \nGrade: 2:1  \nBTEC Level 3 Extended Diploma in Engineering | UTC Central Bedfordshir e, 2014-2016  \nGrade: D*D*D*  \nGCSEs | The Webber Independent School, Milton Keynes , 2012-2014  \nAWARDS & DISTINCTION S \nLeeds Partnership Nominee  (2020)  & Duke of York Gold (2017), Outstanding Student Award for Physics (2014)  \nENGINEERING PROJECTS  \nYear 4: Enhanced Oil Recovery Using Nanoparticle  \n The Masters’ research project involved the functionalisation of carboxylic and silica nanoparticles which had the \ncapability of reducing the interfacial tension and wettability required to enhance oil recovery within the reservoir.  \n The Stober technique was ut ilised for the functionalisation  of carboxylic acid silica nanoparticles along with \ncharacterisations methods such as scanning (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) for analysis of \nnanoparticles.  \n Collected extensive amount of data from laborator y experiments and similar existing published papers. The data \nwas analysed and the results and their potential impact on society were presented to technical and non -technical \naudiences  \nYear 3: Design of a Styrene Production Plant  \n As the major component of the IChemE accredited Design Project, I completed a detailed design of a heat exchanger \nnetwork for a styrene production plant. The  project involved in -depth research into existing heat exchanger s \ncalculation  methods, analysis of experiment data, and extensive use of Microsoft Excel.  \n Led a team of 5 people to research and design a suitable facility to produce  styrene, investigating  required  raw \nmaterials and performing mass & energy balances  and HAZOP.  \n Utilised AutoCAD and Aspen HYSYS to create a complete engineering drawing of the column and to validate the \ncalculation respectively.  \nYear 2 : Production of Acetaldehyde and Heat Exchanger Design  \n Led and coordinated a team of 5 to design a new vapour pressure process to produce acetaldehyde.  \n Development of a shell and tube heat exchanger which involved the calculations of mass and energy balances, \npressure drop and heat transfer.  \nTECHNICAL SKILLS \nMS Office  MATLAB  ANSYS Fluent  Aspen HYSYS  AutoCAD  Visio  R \n \nEXPERIENCE HIGHLIGHTS  \nLaboratory Technician  | UK Biocentre , January  2021– Present  \n Managed and performed quality control checks on COVID -19 samples from receipt through to sample processing \nand storage in accordance with  laboratory procedures (e.g. use of SOP ’s). \n Operated and maintained laboratory equipment  such as liquid handling robot operation (Tecan Freedom Evo), RNA \nextractions using the automated Thermo Scientific Kingfisher and qPCR plate preparation.  \n \nFastFuture Programme  | Avado, September 2020 – January  2020  \nThis was a virtual placement which aimed to enhance students ’ understanding of the importance of digital and data within \nestablished companies such as AstraZeneca, digital marketing strategies and finance fundamentals. Webinars were led by \nleading experts from AstraZeneca, BT Sport, Legal & General and Barclays through the Avado learning platform.   \nKey Accomplishments:  \n Successfully collaborated with others to deliver a presentation highlighting how technology can be used to make a \nchange in people ’s lives and reduce environmental impact, leading to a more sustainable life for the attention of \nBT Sport.  \nEngineering Officer Intern | Royal Navy, June 2019 – August 2019  \nIn control of diagnosing reactors and heat exchangers, implementing engineering principles such as thermodynamics, heat \ntransfer and reaction engineering. Collaborated closely with Engineers at Royal Navy, learning weapon, air, and marine \nengineering.  \nKey Accomplishments:  \n Successfully prepared and delivered a presentation regarding autonomous sy stems for the attention of leading \nindustry experts.  \nCarer | Quantum Care, August 2017 – September 2019  \nCoordinated the delivery of improved care to Dementia patients , studying healthcare plans and formulating daily records \nused by staff. Ensured the accurate completion of all administration and documentation related to patient care.  \nBartender  | Go Houghton & Restaurant, February 2016 – July 2016  \nWorked independently as well as part of the team, prioritising the maintenance of excellent c ustomer service through \nbuilding strong relationships.  Increased sales by 10%.  \nPOSITION OF RESPONSIBILITY  \nChemical Engineering Course Representative  | University of Leeds , October 2019 – July 2020  \nRepresented over 200 peers in course change -related issues, collaborating effectively with students and staff raising genuine \nconcerns.  \nKey Accomplishments:  \n Participated in training and development events organised by the university as well as staff -student forums and \ncommunicating feedback opinions/outcome s to students.  \nChemical Engineering Ambassador |University Of Leeds, October 2017 – October 2019  \nPerformed as a Chemical Engineering Ambassador, interacting with prospective students interested in higher education at \nthe University of Leeds and exhibiting the faculty ’s facilities during open days.  \nKey Accomplishments:  \n Conducted engagements with the community and prospective students, representing the university to higher \nstandards, along with helping new students around the university.  \n ",
