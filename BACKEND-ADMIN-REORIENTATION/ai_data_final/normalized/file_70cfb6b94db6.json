I am eager  for a  new opportunity to utilise my skills and \nknowledge where I can make a meaningful contribution towards  driving sustainability solutions to help \nsolve both business and climate change challenges.  \n \nEducation             \n2013–2017  The University of Sheffield  \nMEng (Hons) Che mical Engineering              Obtained Result: 1st \nResearch Project:  \n• Developing low cost and renewable heterogeneous cata lysts for biodiesel production . \n• Synthesised  and optimised  various catalysts and developed  and trialled  a scale up procedure . \nDesign Project:  \n• Designed a bioethanol fermentation and separation plant in a team of engineers, incorporating \nnovel microbubble distillation and condensation  technology . Independently produced detailed \ndesign of the fermentation unit and plant layout.  \n2006–2013  Macclesfield High School/ College  \n  A Level s – Mathematics (B), Chemistry (B), Biology (B)  \n  AS Level s – Product Design (B)  \n  GCSE s – 14 (2A*, 6A, 6B) including Maths and English  \nRelevant  Experience            \nAug 2019  – Present   Process  Engineer – Wood PLC  \nDeveloped my core process engineering competencies on two world scale FEED project s; designing \na Natural Gas Fractionation facility to be built in the Middle East  and a separate PMC role on a project  \nto design a n olefin complex in Belgium.   Currently d eveloping a company -wide framework for \nembedding sustainability and reliability within i nfrastructure projects.  \n• Actively engage d with a range of stakeholders of varying seniority within the business to gain \n‘buy-in’ and manage strong working relationships to progress a Framework I am developing to \nembed Sustainability and Reliability into inf rastructure projects.  Developing materials to \ndemonstrate current inhouse capabilities and experience to clients.  \n• Responsible for performing adequacy studies on existing NGL fractionation facilities processing a \nchange in mixed feed composition. Developed a Hysys simulation to benchmark existing \nperformance and reviewed as -built equipment design documentation to ident ify bottlenecks and \nidentify potential mitigat ion options for the client to pursue.  \n• Performed study assessments to determine optimum configuration of a compressed air system \nconsidering, CAPEX, OPEX, plot space and safety considerations.  \n• Performed variou s technology and licensor evaluations considering technical feasibility and \neconomic assessments to enable clients to confidently make informed decisions.  Examples \ninclude spent caustic treatment technologies  and licensed sulfur removal units.  \n• Developed  and reviewed key engineering deliverables , such as; Basis of Design (BOD) , Process \nDrawings and Equipment Datasheets . \n• Won first place  in the Associate of Project Management Challenge 2020 , initiating and \ndeveloping a project to deliver grow kits, an  info pack  and lesson to educate children on \nsustainable growing.  As the commercial  lead, I ensured delivery of the project on time and within \nbudget.  \n \nSept 2017 – Aug 2019  Graduate Engineer – Affinity Water  \nGained valuable experience u ndertaking a range of  roles / projects on a two year  graduate schem e. \nProcess Optimisation P roject  \n• Lead a process optimisation project assessing  the performance of  a potable  water treatment site \nin terms of operating costs, process and product quality.  Established a methodology that has \nbeen adopted as the standard company approach  taken  by other  optimisation engineers . \n• Identified a series of solutions to mitigate inefficienc ies, reducing power  consumption , increasing \nwater  quality and reducing waste production  (e.g. installing a bypass to reduce waste product \nand power usage ). Presented potential solutions  to various site stakeholders through \npresentation and report.  \n• Performe d process modelling through mass/flow balances  and onsite tests to  simulate scenarios \nand quantify savings and understand the risk of identified potential  optimisation s. \n• Initiated several of the identified solutions and p rovided onsite technical support to operators \ncontinuing the maintenance of optimal settings.  \nHS2 Water Treatment Project  \n• Working on the design of ultra-filtration treatment plants within the HS2  process  design team . \n• Reviewing design drawings  and documents  to ensuring they comply with company standards.  \nEnergy Strategy P roject  \n• Implement ed a companywide scheme to make energy savings, analysing future requirements for \nalternative energy technologies/ renewables  and engaging with energy companies to perform site \nspecific assessments.  \n• Involved in the i mplement ation of  innovative pump efficiency  technologies  resulting in reduced \nenergy usage and a payback period less than a year.  \nJuly – Aug 2017  Grad uate Researcher  Summer Position – M&I Materials  \n• Assisted in the commissioning of a 10 ML batch ester production plant and contributed to the \nfeasibility study of a conceptual modular ester production plant to operate in multiple climates.  \nJune – Sept 2016  Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) – The \nUniversity of Sheffie ld \n• Awarded the competitive SURF award to develop a platform technology for protein secretion in \nE. Coli, through gene insertion.  Successfully achieved a 3 -fold increase in secretio n rate over \nwhat is already implemented in industry and present my results via a presentation and poster at \na showcase. My work has been credited and  published in a scientific paper.  \nAdditional Skills  and Experience          \n• Experienced with Aspen Hysys sim ulations on several projects.  \n• Skilled in Microsoft Office (Word, Excel, PowerPoint) and SharePoint.  \n• Experience with telemetry , GIS  and Laboratory Information Management Systems.  \n• Full and clean driving licence . \nTraining             \n• APM Project Management training  course . \n• Phoenix H&S in Management training  (IOSH accredited) . \n• Various soft skill training sessions  and in -house technical consistency training modules . \nHobbies  and Interests           \n• A keen sportsman with an interest in rock climbing, snowboar ding and 5 -a-side football . \n• IChemE associate member , actively  working towards Chartership . \n• Actively contribute to company charity and volunteer initiatives; winning an award for ‘Best \nInnovation in the WaterAid Winnovators challenge 2018 and developing training materials for \nyoung professionals as a volunteer committee member of the Wood ‘Early Career s Network’.  \nReferees  – Available upon reques t \n ",
