The upshot of this there is significant risk should an existing Key Account pull back.\nThe idea in the USA and EMEA is that new BDM’s would take the opportunity to target one or more the 20 main potential clients Sasol has identified as strategic to the growth of the business.\nFrom a recruitment standpoint this also makes considerable sense as a candidate with in-depth knowledge of a potential target client – will have a great deal of traction with that client than starting a playbook from scratch\nWe will target candidates who work for companies that service the strategic target companies\nAside from all the aspects of the role in terms of personal care / cosmetics – 5-10 years’ experience we need to focus on the softer skills.\nDrive / Energy / Persistence and an entrepreneurial nature are too name a few\nThe way this sector works is such that the development of business streams requires patience and determination\nFrom a USA BDM perspective the role is different and whilst this proposal does not cover the US sector it is important to note the difference in the two markets. – in the US the search will be for someone who has not just Key account experience but also the ability to identify / build and grow – a distribution network.\nWe have structured our offer in a staggered manner – this is set as such with the greater incentive focused on the final delivery element. It has been specifically designed this way as this will be the first Sasol project, and have based the fee on a mid point of the DE salary.\nIt is our policy to stay clear of current JVCL clients such as BASF and as such we will search in these companies – this approach will be similarly respected in the future with Sasol\nFEE STRUCTURE\nOur typical fees for this search would be 25%, This enables to maintain our long-standing relationship and remain competitive.\nThe costs applicable are broken down into three stages, as follows:\nAll charges are subject to Value Added Tax at the current rate where applicable.\nExpenses\nThe costs applicable in respect of the Retainer are in relation to the Client’s initial instructions to and/or appointment of the Company and all preparatory work undertaken whether on after or before the signing of this agreement. As part of the assignment service we provide, all candidates put forward at shortlist stage will have been personally interviewed and vetted. The expense allocation for interviews, meetings, travel, sustenance, etc. is payable by the client on receipt of invoice, clearly Johnston Vere will endeavour to keep these costs to an absolute minimum.\nGUARANTEE\nIn the event of payment having been received in accordance with our payment terms, then in the event of a candidate leaving of their own volition, we operate a sliding scale refund system:\nIf the candidate leaves within 4 weeks, 75% of the final fee is refunded.\nIf the candidate leaves within 8 weeks, 50% of the final fee is refunded.\nIf the candidate leaves within 12 weeks, 25% of the final fee is refunded.\nA client can elect a replacement candidate in lieu of a refund.\nTHE RECRUITMENT PROCESS\nABOUT US\nJohnston Vere is a niche recruitment consultancy that actually consults!
