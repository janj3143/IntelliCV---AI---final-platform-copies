## üö® IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

### **üî¥ CRITICAL: Deploy Portal Bridge (2 days)**

**Problem:** User portal can't access backend AI services!

**Evidence:**
```python
# user_portal_final/pages/AI_Career_Intelligence.py line 37
try:
    from app.services.portal_bridge import portal_bridge  # ‚ùå FAILS
except ImportError:
    st.warning("‚ö†Ô∏è Backend NLP services not available. Using demo data.")
```

**Solution:** Portal Bridge code is READY in `LOCKSTEP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`

**Steps:**
1. Open `LOCKSTEP_INTEGRATION_PLAN.md`
2. Copy Portal Bridge code (500 lines)
3. Save to `shared_backend/services/portal_bridge.py`
4. Create `backend_final/app/services/` directory
5. Symlink or copy to `backend_final/app/services/portal_bridge.py`
6. Test with user portal pages
7. Verify "Backend not available" warning disappears

**Timeline:** Day 1-2 (IMMEDIATE)
