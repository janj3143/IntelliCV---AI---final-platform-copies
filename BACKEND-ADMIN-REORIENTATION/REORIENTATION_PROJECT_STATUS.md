## üéØ PHASE 2: BACKEND AI SERVICES CREATION - **IN PROGRESS**

### ‚úÖ Completed Components

#### ‚úÖ Step 2.1: Model Training System
**File:** `backend/ai_services/model_trainer.py` (570 lines)

**Features:**
- Train models on existing IntelliCV-data (CVs)
- Multiple training scenarios (job_title, skills, company, industry, experience)
- Admin review queue for flagged predictions
- Error deviation detection (confidence, outliers, consistency)
- Correction feedback loop for continuous improvement
- Model versioning and A/B testing
- Performance metrics tracking

**Training Scenarios:**
1. `job_title_classifier` - Neural Network (0.75 confidence)
2. `skills_extractor` - Hybrid AI (0.70 confidence)
3. `company_classifier` - Neural Network (0.65 confidence)
4. `industry_classifier` - Bayesian (0.80 confidence)
5. `experience_analyzer` - Neural Network (0.70 confidence)

#### ‚úÖ Step 2.2: Neural Network Engine
**File:** `backend/ai_services/neural_network_engine.py` (420 lines)

**Features:**
- Semantic embedding generation (768-dim vectors)
- Semantic similarity calculation (cosine similarity)
- Prediction with confidence scoring (high/medium/low/very_low)
- Continuous learning from user feedback
- Auto-retraining when feedback buffer reaches 500 items
- Performance metrics tracking
- Integration with model_trainer.py

#### ‚úÖ Step 2.3: Expert System Engine
**File:** `backend/ai_services/expert_system_engine.py` (780 lines)

**Features:**
- Rule-based validation system with 10 default business rules
- Admin-editable rules (add/update/delete via API)
- Rule categories: job_title, skills, company, industry, experience
- Priority-based rule evaluation (1-10 scale, higher = more important)
- Explainable AI - explains why validation passed or failed
- Safe rule evaluation (sandboxed Python expressions)
- Rule performance tracking (trigger counts, validation history)
- Auto-save rules to JSON for persistence

**Default Business Rules:**
1. **JT001:** Senior titles require 5+ years experience (Priority 8)
2. **JT002:** C-level positions require leadership skills (Priority 9)
3. **JT003:** Cannot be both junior AND senior (Priority 10)
4. **SK001:** Developer roles must have programming languages (Priority 8)
5. **SK002:** Flag duplicate skills (Priority 5)
6. **CO001:** Company name formatting validation (Priority 4)
7. **CO002:** Cannot have company AND be freelance (Priority 7)
8. **IN001:** Skills should align with industry (Priority 6)
9. **EX001:** Experience years must be 0-50 (Priority 10)
10. **EX002:** Experience must match career timeline (Priority 8)

**Integration:**
- Validates predictions from Neural Network and Bayesian engines
- Provides human-readable explanations for admin review
- Feeds triggered rules to admin dashboard for visibility

#### ‚úÖ Step 2.4: Feedback Loop Engine
**File:** `backend/ai_services/feedback_loop_engine.py` (850 lines)

**Features:**
- Ensemble prediction system - all engines vote, best result wins
- 3 ensemble methods: weighted_vote, highest_confidence, majority_vote
- Automatic feedback distribution to all engines
- Cross-engine learning (NN learns from Bayesian, ES learns from NLP, etc.)
- Performance tracking per engine (accuracy, confidence calibration)
- Auto-weight adjustment - better performing engines get higher weights
- Retraining triggers - auto-retrain after 100 feedback items
- Persistence - saves feedback queue and performance to disk

**How It Works:**
```
User Request ‚Üí Feedback Loop
              ‚Üì
    [NN] [Bayesian] [ES] [NLP] [LLM] [Fuzzy] (all vote)
              ‚Üì
    Weighted Vote ‚Üí Best Prediction
              ‚Üì
    User Correction? ‚Üí Distribute to ALL engines
              ‚Üì
    Each Engine Learns ‚Üí Retrains when threshold reached
```

**Voting Methods:**
- **Weighted Vote:** engine_weight √ó confidence (default)
- **Highest Confidence:** Trust the most confident engine
- **Majority Vote:** Democratic voting with agreement ratio

**Performance Tracking:**
- Total predictions per engine
- Accuracy tracking (correct predictions / total)
- Average confidence per engine
- Confidence calibration (how well confidence predicts accuracy)
- Auto-adjust engine weights based on performance

#### ‚úÖ Step 2.5: Admin UI Dashboard
**File:** `admin_portal/pages/23_AI_Model_Training_Review.py` (670 lines)

**Features:**
- Complete Streamlit dashboard with 5 tabs
- Real-time integration with all backend engines
- Interactive controls for training and review
- Performance visualization with Plotly charts

**Tab 1 - Overview:**
- System status cards (scenarios, trained models, pending reviews, corrections)
- Scenario status table with accuracy and confidence
- Performance trend charts (accuracy by scenario, confidence thresholds)

**Tab 2 - Training Scenarios:**
- Create new scenarios with custom configurations
- View all existing scenarios with details
- Edit scenario parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
- View corrections applied per scenario

**Tab 3 - Train Models:**
- Select scenario to train
- Configure training parameters (epochs, batch size, learning rate)
- Preview training data from IntelliCV-data directory
- Execute training with progress indicators
- View training metrics and results

**Tab 4 - Review Queue:**
- Filter by scenario and status
- Sort by timestamp or confidence
- Review flagged predictions with context
- Approve predictions or provide corrections
- Corrections automatically feed back to training data

**Tab 5 - Performance:**
- Overall system metrics (total predictions, avg accuracy, corrections)
- Engine performance table (accuracy, confidence, weight per engine)
- Expert System rules performance (total rules, validations, most triggered)
- Neural Network metrics (predictions, feedback buffer, embeddings cached)

**Integration:**
- Imports ModelTrainer, NeuralNetworkEngine, ExpertSystemEngine, FeedbackLoopEngine
- Session state management for persistent engines
- Auto-initialization on page load
- Real-time updates when training or reviewing

### ‚è≥ Remaining Components

## üîÑ TWO-TRACK DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY

### SANDBOX Track (User's Production Work)
- **Location:** `c:\IntelliCV-AI\IntelliCV\SANDBOX\`
- **Owner:** User (You!)
- **Purpose:** Continue fixing errors, improving features, production work
- **Changes:** Documented in `SANDBOX_FIXES_LOG.md` (to be created)

### REORIENTATION Track (AI's Architecture Work)
- **Location:** `c:\IntelliCV-AI\IntelliCV\BACKEND-ADMIN-REORIENTATION\`
- **Owner:** AI (Me!)
- **Purpose:** Implement NN/ES, reorganize backend, test new architecture
- **Changes:** Documented in `MIGRATION_LOGS/` (this directory)

### Cross-Feed Strategy
1. **User's fixes ‚Üí AI applies to REORIENTATION**
   - User makes fix in SANDBOX
   - User logs fix in `SANDBOX_FIXES_LOG.md`
   - AI reads log, applies same fix to REORIENTATION

2. **AI's proven patterns ‚Üí Backport to SANDBOX when ready**
   - AI completes feature in REORIENTATION
   - AI tests thoroughly
   - AI documents in `REORIENTATION_BACKPORT_READY.md`
   - User reviews and approves for SANDBOX merge
