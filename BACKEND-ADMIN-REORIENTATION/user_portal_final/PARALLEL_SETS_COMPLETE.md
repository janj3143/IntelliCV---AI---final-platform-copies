## üìä Page Numbering Status

‚úÖ **VERIFIED CORRECT NUMBERING:**

**Professional Pro:**
- 00_Landing.py ‚úÖ
- 01_Registration.py ‚úÖ
- 02_Profile.py ‚úÖ
- 04_Resume_Upload.py ‚úÖ (Fixed from 03 to maintain standard)

**Simple Start:**
- 00_Landing.py ‚úÖ
- 01_Registration.py ‚úÖ
- 02_Profile.py ‚úÖ
- 04_Resume_Upload.py ‚úÖ

**Gap Analysis:**
- Missing 03 in both sets (intentional - standard IntelliCV numbering has Pricing as 03)
- Could add 03_Pricing.py to both if needed
- Current numbering follows original pages/ structure
