## ‚ö†Ô∏è IDENTIFIED OVERLAPS (User Decision Needed)

### üî¥ HIGH PRIORITY - Choose One

**1. Landing Page Conflict**
- `00_Landing.py` - Current main landing page
- `00_Landing_old.py` - Old version
- **Recommendation:** DELETE `00_Landing_old.py` (it's a backup)

**2. Registration/Dashboard Conflict**
- `01_Dashboard.py` - User dashboard (after login)
- `01_Registration.py` - New user registration form
- **Recommendation:** 
  - KEEP both, but RENAME `01_Dashboard.py` ‚Üí `16_Dashboard.py` (makes more sense after profile setup)
  - OR DELETE `01_Dashboard.py` if functionality is covered elsewhere

**3. Job Description Upload Conflict**
- `07_JD_Upload.py` - INTEGRATED version (uses Portal Bridge)
- `20_Job_Description_Upload.py` - Newer version from 25-07 pages
- **Recommendation:** 
  - KEEP `07_JD_Upload.py` (already integrated with Portal Bridge)
  - DELETE `20_Job_Description_Upload.py` (or merge functionality if newer has better features)
