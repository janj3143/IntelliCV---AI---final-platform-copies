is_enterprise = check_user_tier('enterprise_pro')
```

### Premium Feature Gating
```python
if is_premium:
    # Show full functionality
    st.success("✅ Premium feature unlocked!")
    # ... full feature code ...
else:
    # Show greyed-out preview
    st.markdown('<div class="premium-preview">', unsafe_allow_html=True)
    # ... locked feature preview ...
    show_upgrade_prompt("Feature Name", "monthly_pro")
```
