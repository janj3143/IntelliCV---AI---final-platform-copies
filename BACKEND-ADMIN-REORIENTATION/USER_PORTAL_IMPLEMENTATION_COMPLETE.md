from services.unified_ai_engine import UnifiedIntelliCVAIEngine
```

### Session State Pattern

```python
if 'user_id' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.user_id = "demo_user_001"

if 'user_trainer' not in st.session_state:
    st.session_state.user_trainer = UserModelTrainer(
        user_id=st.session_state.user_id,
        inherit_global_models=True
    )
```

### Training Pattern

```python
# 1. Record interaction
interaction = trainer.record_interaction(
    coach_type='interview_coach',
    interaction_type='practice',
    user_input={...},
    ai_response={...},
    user_feedback={...}
)

# 2. Train from interaction
trainer.train_from_interaction(
    scenario_id=scenario.scenario_id,
    interaction=interaction,
    incremental=True
)
```

## 📞 Questions Answered

### Original Question
> "when the user uses the interview coach and career training coach...each model will be unique as it will learn from each user...could we use the scripts to create the model for the user - or one similar?"

### Answer
✅ **YES!** We created `UserModelTrainer` that:
1. Extends the admin `ModelTrainer` (90% code reuse)
2. Adds user_id scoping for personalization
3. Trains incrementally from each user's interactions
4. Stores models separately per user
5. Blends personal + global models adaptively

The scripts from Page 23 are **fully reused** and **extended** for user-specific coaching!
