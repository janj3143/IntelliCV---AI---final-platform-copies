### **PRIORITY 1: EMAIL VERIFICATION BACKEND** 🔴 **CRITICAL**
**File:** `user_portal_final/pages/07_Account_Verification.py`  
**Status:** Stub page - UI exists, backend missing  
**Impact:** **BLOCKING PRODUCTION**

**Why Critical:**
- 🔒 **Security Risk:** Unverified emails allow fake accounts
- 📧 **User Trust:** Professional platforms require email verification
- ⚠️ **Spam Prevention:** Bots can create unlimited accounts
- 💳 **Payment Security:** Can't process payments without verified accounts

**Current State:**
```python
# Line 29: Debug placeholder
st.code("DEBUG-TOKEN-PLACEHOLDER-123456")

# No backend email sending
# No verification token system
# No database verification status
```

**What Needs Implementation:**
1. ✅ Email sending service (SendGrid/AWS SES/Mailgun)
2. ✅ Verification token generation (UUID + expiry)
3. ✅ Database table: `user_verifications` (token, user_id, expires_at, verified_at)
4. ✅ Email templates (HTML + plain text)
5. ✅ Verification endpoint handler
6. ✅ Resend verification email function
7. ✅ Account lockout for unverified users (48h grace period)

- ⚖️ **Compliance:** Some regulations require 2FA for financial transactions

**Current State:**
```python
# Line 19-22: Session state toggle only
enable_2fa = st.checkbox("Enable Two-Factor Authentication", value=st.session_state.get("enable_2fa", False))
st.session_state["enable_2fa"] = enable_2fa

# No TOTP generation
# No QR code display
# No verification code checking
# No recovery codes
```

**What Needs Implementation:**
1. ✅ TOTP library (pyotp) - Time-based One-Time Password
2. ✅ QR code generation for authenticator apps
3. ✅ Secret key storage in database (encrypted)
4. ✅ Recovery codes generation (10 codes)

- 💹 **Revenue Tracking:** Real subscription data needed
- 👥 **User Analytics:** Actual user growth, not mock data
- 🚨 **Error Detection:** Real-time error tracking
- 📈 **Business Decisions:** Mock data can't drive strategy

**Current State:**
```python
# Line 1153: Placeholder comment
# Live data mode (placeholder for real integration)

# Currently generates random mock data:
'user_registrations': random.randint(850, 950)
